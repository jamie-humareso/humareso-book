# Purpose, Values, and Work

<!-- Source: Shake It Off: When the Haters' Hate Really Hurts | 2025-07-30 17:28:56 | https://blog.humareso.com/shake-it-off-when-the-haters-hate-really-hurts | shake-it-off-when-the-haters-hate-really-hurts -->
!Blog Post_Shake It Off (1).png)

Hate. Just typing that word stops me in my tracks.

For the past few weeks, the number of online posts speaking to hate/haters seems to be spiking. Whether it be business owners who can’t keep up with the negative Yelp or Glassdoor reviews, or “Influencers” deluged with anti-fan commentary, or HR and TA practitioners finding themselves in the crosshairs of an online battle they didn’t sign up for, we are seeing many people stressed in response to hate.

And we know the difference between hate and calling someone or something out, right? If your organization supports discriminatory practices, then you can expect to hear about it through a variety of platforms. Discrimination, harassing environments or taking advantage of marginalized people will be called out, as it should be, and those in positions of power in those specific organizations can expect that to come. We live in a world where outrage over those truths will come to light quickly.

Individually, that type of correction does not need to be hateful, but it is certainly going to feel unwelcome. The discipline to change can be received as hate, but the fact is that when your organization is traveling down a wrong path, it will be called out. You should be prepared for that.

On the other hand, and more relevant to recent events, we have people feeling torn up by the unwelcome commentary about their work ethic, their work product and their assumed work performance. For some people, posting online about their work is part of their brand and their marketing strategy. The negative can come in response to one of those posts. Some will respond right under the post mocking your perspective and assuming your frame of reference. Some may quote your post on their page to blast you and tell their audience how dumb you are. Some negativity has also come behind the scenes – reaching out to an event planner to dissuade them from working with you, for instance.

And some of you might say, “Well, if they are going to post, then they have to be ready for all the responses – good and bad.” You would be right. You do have to be ready. Where I think we may be off course a bit, though, is when we go for the jugular of that person. If you don’t like the way someone markets their recruiting efforts, then you can banter about philosophies and approaches, but to go after their role as an employee for a company, or as a mother, or as a human is too far.

So, what do we do? First, if you are going to share your work online, get ready for the pushback. In the United States, in particular, most people operate as armchair quarterbacks. The “expertise” that people believe they have is astounding. To that end, the brazenness to be that “expert” on social media can often be cruel; the studies on “toxic disinhibition” are insightful. We just need to be ready for those types to jump in and be unkind.

Secondly, those who post and share their work need to toughen up a bit. If you are going to walk into a Cyber Colosseum, so to speak, then you need your armor on. It is a battle, and hate is the oft-used weapon of your opponent. The battle preparation for you will consist of grounding – what do you believe in and how does that help to identify you? Lean into the truths of who you know you are, despite the random name-calling coming at you. The more you are grounded, the less impactful the hate will be.

This blog is a tough one to write. I tend to operate with a glass-half-full mentality. I don’t want to give hate more press than it already has. But there are real people who are falling apart. I am seeing and hearing accounts of these attacks online, including DMs to their bosses, colleagues, and yes, even to their adult children.

Let’s take a few moments to check in on our colleagues. This work is hard. Those standing up for others and for ideals need support. Those working hard to build a brand need support. Those trying to improve themselves need support. We can be more committed to that and learn better how to let the effects of hate roll off our backs.

<!-- Source: Wedding Bell Blues – The First Steps to an HR Tech Stack | 2023-05-11 11:00:00 | https://blog.humareso.com/first-steps-to-an-hr-tech-stack | first-steps-to-an-hr-tech-stack -->
When you’re five years old, a wedding cake looks massive. It’s not to say that at six feet, three inches, these cakes are minuscule now, but as a young boy, I was a ring bearer for the first time at five years old. I got to do that job a couple of times, actually. And one of my favorite parts of it all was the dessert. The sweet table filled with various cookies, mini-cakes, and other sugary dreams had my already large eyes bugging out of my head. However, the many-tiered wedding cake was a full stop for me. Yes, please, and multiple slices.

I can’t help but think of that four- or five-tiered expression of sweet joy when I consider HR tech stacking in the workplace. And let’s be honest, it’s not because of the sugary sweetness of technology that I think of it. Rather, it’s much more about the stability of the cake as each layer supports the one above. Healthy, viable tech stacking in the workplace is built deliberately and supportively to the main functions to be achieved.

You may have tech stacking at your workplace and not even know it. For instance, if you use an applicant tracking system (ATS) to receive responses to your job postings, whether resumes or applications, then that is step one in the most basic “workplace wedding cakes.” The widest volume of people interactions happens at this entry point. Consider how many people apply for open roles at your organization. Certainly, not all of them will become employees, but the repository may have four times as many applications as employees, if not a much higher multiplier. That’s a wide pool to manage to affirm candidate experience, company branding, and hiring manager accountability. There are automatic triggers in communication to applicants and internal stakeholders to the process that should be in place. The flow of information is crucial at this stage.

Perhaps your company adds a tier in employee assessments, whether job-related to process or culturally considerate to personality or motivations, to this tech stack. If you use screenings of various kinds, that layer would sit on the ATS. Those online assessments might get activated automatically because of a certain level hit in the candidate selection process, or perhaps you manually request them online with the information then flowing into the applicant process.

The next layer is added when an offer of employment is requested, delivered, and accepted. The human resources information system (HRIS) picks up with that acceptance and electronically distributes the onboarding documentation. The new hire gets to complete the W4, I9, state and local required documents along with direct deposit, employee handbook receipt, and other pertinent policy advisements. For some of you, you are still doing all that was listed above in paper form. Oh, I am so sorry. There is an easier way, honestly, and it doesn’t break the bank to do so.

Many payroll systems function as an HRIS (or at least an HRMS – human resources management system) to electronically distribute and store employee onboarding documentation. That tier in the HR tech stack allows for monitoring in the completion process to be done remotely. With more organizations having employees work in a geographically distributed role, handling HR processes technologically from anywhere adds positively to the employee experience as well as affirms organizational relevance in the eyes of the new hire.

We’ve only built the first three layers of the “workplace wedding cake,” but there are other tiers to be added. The more robust of a hiring or employee life-cycle process, the more a company needs to develop a specific HR technology stack flow.

Start with what you have access to currently. Look at the options and features that you may have as part of your current contract. Why aren’t they activated? What fears are there to do so? Who owns the activation – should it be someone in-house or do you need an external HR project manager to get it set up correctly?

Sit with your team and sketch out this cake. How many layers to start? (Parts of the process to handle) What flavor of cake? (Think technological representation of the values of the company) What icing? (Think organizational branding) What decorations? (Think who gets to be involved and what they represent about the company) And the best part might be the taste-testing (Think demos with a few technology vendors) so that you can see what options make the most sense for your plans.

Tech stacking isn’t scary, nor should it make you sad. It just requires some consideration, planning, and activation. These are the bones of what HR does regularly, anyway.

<!-- Source: Take This Job and Shove It: Quitting During a Recession | 2023-01-04 17:48:44 | https://blog.humareso.com/quitting-during-a-recession | quitting-during-a-recession -->
!Humareso Blog Posts-45It’s a weird time. Yes, I know, there’s always something weird about society, but I am not sure we’ve seen such business realities colliding as we do today. We are on the precipice of an economic recession (if not already entered into it). The degree of severity for this recession is not yet known, but we’ve already seen major organizations, like Amazon and Meta, laying off tens of thousands of workers. In previous years where mass separation numbers like these occurred, employees hunkered down and hoped to keep their current positions. That is not the posture of today.

According to The Bureau of Labor and Statistics, most of 2022 saw Quit Rates tripling the Layoff Rate. For instance, in October of 2022, 1.4 million people were laid off, but 4 million people quit their job. We knew in October that a downturn was upon us. The news media was touting the layoffs at Twitter and DoorDash as signs of a tough economy coming home to roost in the US. So, why the brazen disregard for the signs by American workers?

Remember when Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill) in Wolf Of Wall Street quite his job after meeting Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) in a diner and finding out Jordan made $74,000 in a month? Donnie just calls his furniture-selling boss and quits right then and there. He had no idea how the money was going to be made, but he took the risk. But not all employees today are primarily making a jump from their employer because of money.

A focus on well-being hit all-time highs last year. After the agony of the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw more people in need of emotional and mental support. The uncertainty of the future, the change in social dynamics, the lack of personal presence and interaction all combined to make things difficult, if not unbearable, for many. That strain forced many people to evaluate why they work where they work and how that work gets done. “Is this what I want to be about?” was a readily asked question, not only internally, but often made its way to stand-up and weekly work meetings. The fear of response by leadership to such a question was no longer a major consideration. And when leaders couldn’t answer that question well, employees left. They still are.

Stay interviews may very well be a good first step within your organization. Asking employees who are working why they have chosen to stay at the company will illuminate mood, successes, failings, culture vibe and professional development. There’s gold in them there hills! Ask good questions. Don’t fear the answers. If there’s a want expressed by an employee, it’s better for it to be shared and addressed. If it cannot happen, after consideration, share that. To know means that I’m not guessing. I’m not wasting time mulling over what the company might or might not do. I have clarity and can make an educated choice as a result.

We have employees who are bolder about living in authentic ways. That may very well be a new experience for you. If you walk into these situations with an authoritarian approach rather than seeking to understand, you may be met with a wish for you to take this job and shove it. People are less likely to put up with inconsistency and the status quo. They are braver and will take their chances in the job market. Or in the gig economy. Or become an entrepreneur. The options are easier to access.

Paying attention to the economy, job markets, competition and other indicators is our responsibility. This weird time doesn’t mean we should throw out the review of metrics. Look at what is happening but refrain from drawing the straight line that you used to. The results may vary.

<!-- Source: I Think It’s Love: Planning for More Than an Emotional Organizational Connection During Hiring | 2023-04-04 17:07:09 | https://blog.humareso.com/ithinkitslove | ithinkitslove -->
!Humareso Blog Posts-15-LoveI had the chance to watch a rerun of The Love Boat recently. Yes, Pluto TV and I are good friends. I get to watch lots of old programming (The Price is Right – The Barker Years is a particular treat), and I often have an episode with the Pacific Princess playing on a Sunday afternoon while I prep for the week ahead. The guest stars are absolutely amazing. Don’t scoff. Take a peek at the long list of A-listers that rubbed elbows with the D-Listers. On this particular episode, Eddie Mekka played a high school friend of “Julie, Your Cruise Director” (it’s a requirement to say it together) who, within 30 seconds of being on the ship, sees the love of his life. He didn’t speak to her. He hadn’t heard her voice. He just saw her from afar and decided that she was “the one.” And, of course, in true Love Boat fashion, that three-day cruise, after some fumbling and lying, proved his wish to be granted. He and Audrey Landers left the boat with plans to marry. See? Easy.  
  
It got me thinking about how we approach career opportunities in a similar fashion. We look to fall in love and to do so quickly.  
  
Be honest. Haven’t you walked into an interview or logged onto your video appointment hoping to get “that feeling?” It’s not to say that you don’t care about the work, the community or the structure of the organization. It’s just that you might want to get the butterflies in your belly first.  
  
Walking in holistically prepared for that interview (throughout the whole process, actually) is likely the best way to avoid a sensory-biased decision-making process. Have a plan of engagement which includes your perspectives and questions based upon some legwork you’ve done regarding the company’s work, history, reviews, cultural insights, etc. Remember, this is an interview for the organization as much as it is for you.  
  
I am in the throws of some hiring now. Truthfully, I am keeping track of the approach. Less than 8% of those I am interviewing ask any questions…at all. I specifically leave time towards the end of the interview to invite the asking of anything about the organization. More than 90% of the time, the interviewee says something like, “Thank you, but I don’t have any questions. I just want to say how excited I am about this opportunity.”  
  
Look, I love that people want to work with the awesome team that’s been assembled (Avengers!), but there should be things about the company that you would want to know. Ask about the organization’s commitment to excellence in its work. Ask about how an equitable environment has been created and fostered (and if it’s not yet there, ask about what the hold up is). Ask about why this role is open. If it’s an additional role, ask how it was determined that this was the right time to add. If it’s a replacement role, ask why the previous employee moved out of the job. Ask about the manner with which investment in the persons of the company are made, not just in benefits (certainly including this, though), but also in areas of competency development, work-life integration, community involvement and the like.  
  
This prep work will balance out the emotional desire to “just know” that this is the right place for your next role. There is nothing wrong with enjoying a stroll around the deck in the moonlight while wearing a chiffon gown. However, the engine room, the laundry room and the staff quarters are just as important to get a true view if you’re planning on investing yourself on that ship.

<!-- Source: Ten Years: John Baldino Celebrates Humareso’s Impact in Human Resources | 2022-08-01 17:30:00 | https://blog.humareso.com/john-baldino-celebrates-ten-years-of-humareso | john-baldino-celebrates-ten-years-of-humareso -->
In the song, “Ten Years” by Paul Simon, he pens:

*Ten years come and gone so fast**I might as well have been dreaming**Sunny days have burned a path**Across another season**A fortune rises to the sky*

It’s as if Mr. Simon is inside my mind on this special day. Ten years ago, Humareso began. I remember sitting at breakfast with a business owner the day after I left my VP role with a national lender. He sat across from me and asked, “So what are you going to do now?” For a moment, I heard that question reverberate in my subconscious. My most honest answer was, “I have no idea.” Instead, what spilled out was a business conviction. Companies did not have all the resources necessary to provide functional organizational drive and impactful cultural change.

I looked across at my breakfast date and shared a vision of businesses with innovation as a core component to every job description while maintaining thoughtfulness to each compliance nuance offered through legislation and case law. My experience in two handfuls of industries showed me that there was a best way to engage with people in spite of varied technical skill and geographic considerations. There were universal truths. And the markets were screaming for them to be incorporated into every organization from start-ups to enterprise corporations.

The entrepreneurial spirit had been dormant inside of me for too long and this was the right time to step out. And so, when that breakfast companion finished having eggs and listening to me for almost an hour, he said, “Done. Let’s get started with my company.” I had Humareso’s first client.

Emboldened by proof that my idea had legs, I set out to talk to other companies within my sphere of influence. And before long, I was working on a full docket (and then some) of clients of various industries who wanted to know what good human resources should look like. There were hints at some of them; one had a wonderful HR Director who was trying to do great HR, but had a CEO who thought he knew better. When he asked me to come in to help, he regretted that decision quickly. Most of my time was spent with him reshaping how he thought things should go and figuring out where his mode of critical thinking was born. He saw the light, and again, it was confirmation that this road for Humareso was the right one.

These ten years later, I can look back at the paths worn by travel and faded by the sun. The gains have far outweighed the gaps. The Humareso team has left a mark of richness, integrity and creativity that I could never have achieved without them. I could not express my gratitude any deeper than by sharing my heartfelt and tearful thanks (yes, I am still a crier…). To have been entrusted with the development of so many within our organization so that they, too, can transform others is core to my credo of sacrificial leadership. You have built Humareso with me.

Fostering deeper business relationships, speaking at dozens of conferences and events, writing hundreds of blogs, partnering with other HR and technology organizations have all been highlights through these years. The love that Twitter gave me early on as an HR pro helped to propel the message of Humareso faster than I had anticipated. By year 3, we were operating as if it were year 5 (based on my projections), and year 10 has us continuing to be a couple of years ahead, even with the updates. Our HRO program began winning awards. The work that we are doing is rich and meaningful. We have impacted tens of thousands of employees. That is not a number to take lightly; I am humbled by just the thought of it let alone the notes of gratitude we’ve gotten through these years.

I’m not sure I could have imagined today when I first started. My family encouraged me towards it; they encouraged me away from my fears and into the greatness they saw coming. I have been broken and blessed, which is a path for all of us. For it is in that reality that truth comes shining through – the things you can count on, the beliefs that will truly guide. And as I sit here with ten years of Humareso success to celebrate, I know that there is still more to come. The sun will continue to show those paths, and the fortune found in deepening relationships and positively changed organizations will be the legacy I strive towards. Cheers to Humareso and to all of you for making it so.

<!-- Source: Coming Up - Joy at Work, Home and Within Self | 2022-12-09 15:26:00 | https://blog.humareso.com/coming-up | coming-up -->
Afresh. That’s the word for 2023. Yup, I’ve decided. Feel free to use the word in sentences throughout the year. “Hmm, I am tired of these clothes. Maybe if I pair things afresh, I won’t hate everything I own in my closet.” “The marriage is stale. The relationship needs some life afresh.” “While I appreciate the dinner you’ve made, looking at your recipes afresh would be a welcome change.” (Let me know how that one goes)

There are many ways to use the word. It’s applicable at home or work, with friends or family, and for pleasure or for business. It’s the starting point for change. A review of what’s happening and how to revitalize it, whether by approach or adoption. It’s the challenge to look at what’s coming up and infuse enthusiasm into it. Afresh is intentional.

When we look at work process, for instance, how can we see it afresh? The complacency that settles in due to the routine of work, whether onsite, at home or remotely, affects what we think of work. We can become stagnant and hate the fact that we’ve become stagnant.

The joy of work is different than being happy at work. Ouch. That one might sting a bit. We don’t mind being proactive at work if we’re happy, but if we’re unhappy or marginally connected at best, then we don’t have the energy or desire. We want to be inspired first. Someone needs to come along, usually a manager or business leader, and help me get happy (again, if ever). Once that happens, then I am most willing to approach work afresh.

Truth be told, that’s not likely to happen. Your happiness is not a commodity that managers trade well. Many managers are working out their own happiness, and the ebb and flow of emotion is not a competency taught or practiced in most (if not, any) courses of study. Why would we place such a burden into the hands of management? Further, why would I want a manager to have a say in my happiness?

This is where seeing joy afresh is helpful. Joy is mine. I get to focus on this state of being, distinctly different than happiness, and determine where my stability comes from. When I approach work process afresh, I don’t want to manufacture a feeling, but rather, I want to operate out of what’s coming up in me. My joy is mine. I am anchored in truths that encourage joy in my heart and mind. Now, when innovation and creativity are asked of me, I am eager to do so because it means something to me as a result of who I know I am. I have great joy in that. Happiness comes and goes, but joy doesn’t have to.

The challenge of joy is that we want to feel it every day. Listen, I love my three kids. There’s nothing I wouldn’t do for them. They are remarkable adults and make me proud at every turn. BUT, they don’t live with me anymore. They are off in college, grad school and beyond, making their own way, living in their joy, even when they don’t feel happy (it’s finals time!). I don’t live daily in state of their presence, but it does not diminish my joy. I may miss them. I may not be happy at moments because of that; however, my joy in who they are and how I’ve been allowed to be a part of that truth is mine, regardless of the circumstances. That’s how joy should operate in your life. Take the time to look at joy afresh.

Our organizations need us to push for fresh looks. The messaging of 2022 included a push to bring your whole self to work. Some of you might not be excited about that, not because work shouldn’t ask for that (that’s an entirely different blog post!), but because you haven’t been thrilled with who you are. That’s okay. Today is the day to approach yourself afresh. It’s not about resolutions, but it’s about commitment, habits to encourage those commitments and surrounding yourself with people who will love you through those commitments.

The next year is yours. Every year is yours, though. Don’t allow another day to go by without reflection and a path towards patterned change in your life. Yes, work needs you to be your healthiest. Your relationships need that, too. You need you to be your stabilized best. It’s time for life afresh.

<!-- Source: Let’s Get Serious: Relevance over Trendiness | 2022-09-30 15:53:24 | https://blog.humareso.com/lets-get-serious-relevance-over-trendiness | lets-get-serious-relevance-over-trendiness -->
Overalls were a trend for a bit in the 1990’s. I had both the Kris Kross shorts version of overalls as well as the seven sizes too big pair of full overalls. Truly, I could have fit another person in there with me (don’t ask if I did…I would have to lie). Naturally, my dance moves while wearing the shorts version of overalls were on fleek. I was complimented for my stylish choices in clothing. Yet, when I look at pictures now of those huge overalls, I struggle to remember if the trend was ever attractive.

Trendy is not always helpful. It usually isn’t, to be honest. In work, the latest and greatest terms, issues and supposed chasms can serve as a distraction to an organization. We may run around chasing after those “quiet quitting” or those in the “great reshuffle.” Or we tell ourselves today we must be an inclusive culture but then tomorrow focus on being a best-in-class organization. The ebbing of our attention can show our immaturity and lack of seriousness.

How do we get serious?

* **Slow and Steady test** – Not everything you read should be acted upon. That sentence may have just freed your mind. Even if it’s a promising idea, the bandwidth to tackle every opportunity is limited. Trying to put five good ideas into place at the same time may translate into five bad outcomes. And then trying to resuscitate them later is met with more resistance than you would have faced originally. The uphill climb is steeper, and the blame lies with you.
* **Grain of Salt test** – Not everything that everyone writes or shares is correct. Boom, facts. Some people like to be trendy because it gets them likes and clicks. Their goals are different from yours. Take declarative and command statements with that grain of salt. Research more than one perspective and know the pros and cons. “Experts” may not have worked in the field for decades (or ever!) so be careful. We have the opportunity, sometimes only once, to sit with our leadership team and share these ideas; if we don’t come prepared, then we can lose credibility quickly.
* **Truth or Dare test** – Relevance is a slippery slope. It’s not only the sharer of perspectives that is trying to be relevant, but the hearer and doer, too. Sometimes we can feel as though if we don’t do something, we might be seen as yesterday’s news. The action doesn’t make you relevant, but impact does. That’s why tried and true methods can still work and be adopted. The relevance isn’t in the trendiness but in the positive business impact, and that is ALWAYS relevant.

This is why we must be vigilant in our trendiness quotient. New ideas are important. We can’t just do things as we have without testing their impact and validity. But a better way to do things is not the same thing as being trendy. Trendiness becomes unappealing and ineffective in a short amount of time. Your team knows it.

Listen, I’m not wearing either of those overalls at this point. And let’s be thankful for that!

<!-- Source: Do You Hear the People Sing? | 2020-11-05 05:00:00 | https://blog.humareso.com/do-you-hear-the-people-sing-compromise | do-you-hear-the-people-sing-compromise -->
Gridlock has stymied countless organizations, governments and relationships. The unwavering “dig-in” of sides or individuals where blockades are erected to show how much certain ideas and position matter.  And to be fair, some of these blockades do matter. Values are real and ought to cause both protective and assertive action. The people will rise, hopefully, ready to compromise.

Every time I see the makeshift blockade from Les Miserables, I sit in awe. Random pieces of furniture – tables, chairs, bureaus – along with rugs, logs, crates and more come together as a symbol of tenacity, fortitude and commitment. Those rebellious front-runners stood on values of health and opportunity. They rose in opposition to the government that would not help secure them, and in some ways, fostered degradation. Dig in, Revolutionaries, dig in.

However, we cannot break desks and chairs daily in our organizational communication and dynamics efforts, at least not daily. Is everything blockade-worthy?

### What is Compromise?

Compromise is a valuable ally, and it is one whose value has been untapped in many companies. Some organizations have labeled success in compromise when, despite initially having just one choice, three kinds of requested K-Cups are available to staff. Accommodation is not the same as compromise. According to Gottman Institute research, “Compromise never feels perfect. Everyone gains something and everyone loses something.” That’s how compromise works.

### Compromise in Organizations

In an organizational dynamic, compromise is the right alignment of influence bartering. There are ways individuals, departments and divisions can have their needs handled by the supportive influence of other individuals, departments and divisions. The very best managers recognize that their influence is directly connected to their willingness and acceptance of others’ influence. Compromise is dependent upon how and when this influence is exercised by each and all parties connected.

It’s in this way that compromise is different than cooperation. Pulling together towards a common goal or affirmed value is, by practice, what good cooperation looks like. I mean, how many of those team building retreats do you have to go on to learn this one? Don’t drop this dude, link arms, bend at the knees. If the principles of compromise are applied here in addition, in order for the desired cooperation to occur, compromise in methodology, amount of effort and dismount tactic will happen. No one person may have his/her/their way met completely.

That’s usually the sign of immaturity in your companies. Which supervisor has a “my way or the highway” attitude? Better, which C-Suite leader has a “my way or the highway” course of repeated action? Ouch. You know it happens. The art of compromise is lost on this influential individual and in its wake a lack of trust and a lack of care settle in by those around such a leader. The question asked by that leader should not be one of “Are you going to go my way?” but rather “Which ways are value-centric rather than preferential?” There can be a canyon of difference in the answers to the latter.

### Directed Influence

Those blockades might be ready for dismantling while some may need reinforcement. Compromise is not about weakness; it is about directed influence. The “growing up” of management is sorely lacking in some of the smallest and largest organizations today. Address it with a real roadmap which includes an understanding of what matters and how compromise fits. Teach leaders how to survey the “land” and observe the signs. Ask them, “Do you hear the people sing?”
