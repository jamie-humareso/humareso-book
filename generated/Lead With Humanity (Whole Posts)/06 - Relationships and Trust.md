Hate. Just typing that word stops me in my tracks.

For the past few weeks, the number of online posts speaking to hate/haters seems to be spiking. Whether it be business owners who can’t keep up with the negative Yelp or Glassdoor reviews, or “Influencers” deluged with anti-fan commentary, or HR and TA practitioners finding themselves in the crosshairs of an online battle they didn’t sign up for, we are seeing many people stressed in response to hate.

And we know the difference between hate and calling someone or something out, right? If your organization supports discriminatory practices, then you can expect to hear about it through a variety of platforms. Discrimination, harassing environments or taking advantage of marginalized people will be called out, as it should be, and those in positions of power in those specific organizations can expect that to come. We live in a world where outrage over those truths will come to light quickly.

Individually, that type of correction does not need to be hateful, but it is certainly going to feel unwelcome. The discipline to change can be received as hate, but the fact is that when your organization is traveling down a wrong path, it will be called out. You should be prepared for that.

On the other hand, and more relevant to recent events, we have people feeling torn up by the unwelcome commentary about their work ethic, their work product and their assumed work performance. For some people, posting online about their work is part of their brand and their marketing strategy. The negative can come in response to one of those posts. Some will respond right under the post mocking your perspective and assuming your frame of reference. Some may quote your post on their page to blast you and tell their audience how dumb you are. Some negativity has also come behind the scenes – reaching out to an event planner to dissuade them from working with you, for instance.

And some of you might say, “Well, if they are going to post, then they have to be ready for all the responses – good and bad.” You would be right. You do have to be ready. Where I think we may be off course a bit, though, is when we go for the jugular of that person. If you don’t like the way someone markets their recruiting efforts, then you can banter about philosophies and approaches, but to go after their role as an employee for a company, or as a mother, or as a human is too far.

So, what do we do? First, if you are going to share your work online, get ready for the pushback. In the United States, in particular, most people operate as armchair quarterbacks. The “expertise” that people believe they have is astounding. To that end, the brazenness to be that “expert” on social media can often be cruel; the studies on “toxic disinhibition” are insightful. We just need to be ready for those types to jump in and be unkind.

Secondly, those who post and share their work need to toughen up a bit. If you are going to walk into a Cyber Colosseum, so to speak, then you need your armor on. It is a battle, and hate is the oft-used weapon of your opponent. The battle preparation for you will consist of grounding – what do you believe in and how does that help to identify you? Lean into the truths of who you know you are, despite the random name-calling coming at you. The more you are grounded, the less impactful the hate will be.

This blog is a tough one to write. I tend to operate with a glass-half-full mentality. I don’t want to give hate more press than it already has. But there are real people who are falling apart. I am seeing and hearing accounts of these attacks online, including DMs to their bosses, colleagues, and yes, even to their adult children.

Let’s take a few moments to check in on our colleagues. This work is hard. Those standing up for others and for ideals need support. Those working hard to build a brand need support. Those trying to improve themselves need support. We can be more committed to that and learn better how to let the effects of hate roll off our backs.

The only way forward is progress, a rousing sentiment. But I have seen the opposite be the way forward—regress. Falling behind, disastrous choices, infighting, broken processes…shall I continue? We likely all have experienced some of this. Do we forego the pithy sentiment about progression?

The objective motivator is the individual contribution by each, not by all. Sentiment becomes watered down when it’s generalized to all. We all know that “Hang in There” cat poster (thank you to that awesome show, The Middle, for memorializing it for posterity). When delivered to the whole, it is simply positive sentiment without real direction. However, when delivered to an individual, it becomes personal. What do I need to do in order to hang in there? The individual delivery is meant to be thought-provoking and encouraging.

When it comes to progress, the same objective can be offered specifically. The only way forward is progress as an individualized objective pushes the receiver to consider what that person can do as well as what is needed in order to do so. That’s progress. Walking into a department and saying, “Do Better” is generalized. A manager should not expect a team member to rise to the occasion after such a broad admonition. The path of least resistance is to say to one’s self, “I am doing the better. It’s everyone else.” And that is most often the end of the line of “motivation.”

Instead, if a department needs to do better, seek to address the individuals. The opening mandate to all may set the stage for what’s to come, but it’s the one-on-one dialogue that will bring to light those reflective considerations.

“Joe, the organization needs us to do better. What do you see as being an area of improvement we should address? How can you help to address that suggestion, and what will that take for you to do so?” This might be the purest way to start an individual check-in. And lest you think that each person will automatically say, “Oh, it’s me. I am the problem and will change my evil ways immediately,” (we’re so bitter, aren’t we?) it may take a moment or two for someone to get beyond the reason why it’s actually Marty’s fault that everything is crap. With some gentle, consistent questions, Joe will begin to think personally. “Well, Marty is part of the problem. I can see that we’ve become less motivated to do a great job. We have become okay with a passable job.” Those we-statements are code for I-statements, often done due to a lack of organizational trust or out of fear from previous interactions. Meet that person in those illuminating moments by affirming the perspective and asking to understand more deeply.

It is not easy for a first-time supervisor to draw out such reflection from a team. It takes practice. If you are a first-time manager, give yourself some grace.

And to those of you who get asked about progression and how you can participate, participate. Talk to your supervisor. Be gracious, thoughtful, and innovative. You do not need to be a doormat to do that. Focus on what you can do first. Or, I guess you could respond like Axl from **The Middle**, “…Together we are awesome. But alone, only I am still awesome.”

Confidentially, who can you speak to confidentially? The circle of trust exists for all of us, whether detailed or happenstance. We know who we can talk to, really talk to. The hard truth is that there may not be as many as we might hope, perhaps even highlighting that there isn’t anyone we really trust at all.

Recently, I have had the opportunity to listen to a group of people collectively and individually as they work through a conflict. The group gathered based upon one item of tension, but what has come through is that this one item isn’t really the issue. The friction is because there is rampant mistrust within the group. Even those who’ve postured to be simpatico with another have been found to share differently when in a one-on-one conversation. Sub-tier agendas have broken the hope for reconciliation. And now, people are left to merely jockey for empty position. Disheartening to say the least.

Yet, for as upsetting as this is, organizational leadership regularly deals with this. It’s regrettably commonplace in some of your companies. The faux friendships are in place as a mechanism to hold onto a position or to be seen as a “team player” for the next advancement. The work you do matters, for sure, but the politics of relationship cannot be ignored. There are companies that promote trust as a value despite the activity that shows otherwise. Have you fallen into that pattern?

This is not about being bleak. It is about recognizing a broken framework. Are you a participant in the brokenness?

In what has become a classic, Meet the Parents explores this concept of the circle of trust directly, and of course, with hilarity. Robert DeNiro is at his over-the-top best as protector and government agent father to Ben Stiller’s neurotic, over-compensating future son-in-law. DeNiro uses trust as a weapon for most of the movie and Stiller works to earn a reprieve from the perceived doubt. If it weren’t funny, it would be primarily awkward and frustrating (it might be that for you anyway!).

Is that how it is for you at work? And for those of you who do your work 100% remotely, do you find that it’s been doable to build the rapport necessary to function in the mechanic of your organization? Over the last year, more employees have been added to companies in a remote capacity that had never been in the office previously. The manner with which trust is built will need to be more intentional with those whom we don’t bump into during the day. Have you made a different effort to be inclusive of those teammates who exist elsewhere?

The first step is to ask yourself: What am I doing to participate in any unhealthy trust construct at my organization? This is not about accusation but awareness. You cannot change what you don’t recognize. Look deeply at your involvement in any brokenness.

The second step is to ask: What is my company doing to support functionally broken trust amongst its people? If the status quo has deep roots in positional jockeying and backstabbing, then those weapons need to be addressed. Those who wield them today and attack those around them may find that tomorrow puts them on the defensive. It’s a quick switch to a protective posture. Your role involves calling it out, at whatever level you find yourself. Open the door to discuss, address and invoke change. (Some additional thoughts on building healthy trust can be found at: 

It is sad to watch a group of people live in such mistrust of one another. Backbiting is exhausting. Wearing masks to hide true feelings affects mental health. Why would anyone need to live like this? It’s okay for us to disconnect the mechanisms and change the construct. If, ultimately, it didn’t work out for DeNiro’s tough guy, how could we stand a chance? Fuggedaboutit.

Gridlock has stymied countless organizations, governments and relationships. The unwavering “dig-in” of sides or individuals where blockades are erected to show how much certain ideas and position matter.  And to be fair, some of these blockades do matter. Values are real and ought to cause both protective and assertive action. The people will rise, hopefully, ready to compromise.

Every time I see the makeshift blockade from Les Miserables, I sit in awe. Random pieces of furniture – tables, chairs, bureaus – along with rugs, logs, crates and more come together as a symbol of tenacity, fortitude and commitment. Those rebellious front-runners stood on values of health and opportunity. They rose in opposition to the government that would not help secure them, and in some ways, fostered degradation. Dig in, Revolutionaries, dig in.

However, we cannot break desks and chairs daily in our organizational communication and dynamics efforts, at least not daily. Is everything blockade-worthy?

### What is Compromise?

Compromise is a valuable ally, and it is one whose value has been untapped in many companies. Some organizations have labeled success in compromise when, despite initially having just one choice, three kinds of requested K-Cups are available to staff. Accommodation is not the same as compromise. According to Gottman Institute research, “Compromise never feels perfect. Everyone gains something and everyone loses something.” That’s how compromise works.

### Compromise in Organizations

In an organizational dynamic, compromise is the right alignment of influence bartering. There are ways individuals, departments and divisions can have their needs handled by the supportive influence of other individuals, departments and divisions. The very best managers recognize that their influence is directly connected to their willingness and acceptance of others’ influence. Compromise is dependent upon how and when this influence is exercised by each and all parties connected.

It’s in this way that compromise is different than cooperation. Pulling together towards a common goal or affirmed value is, by practice, what good cooperation looks like. I mean, how many of those team building retreats do you have to go on to learn this one? Don’t drop this dude, link arms, bend at the knees. If the principles of compromise are applied here in addition, in order for the desired cooperation to occur, compromise in methodology, amount of effort and dismount tactic will happen. No one person may have his/her/their way met completely.

That’s usually the sign of immaturity in your companies. Which supervisor has a “my way or the highway” attitude? Better, which C-Suite leader has a “my way or the highway” course of repeated action? Ouch. You know it happens. The art of compromise is lost on this influential individual and in its wake a lack of trust and a lack of care settle in by those around such a leader. The question asked by that leader should not be one of “Are you going to go my way?” but rather “Which ways are value-centric rather than preferential?” There can be a canyon of difference in the answers to the latter.

### Directed Influence

Those blockades might be ready for dismantling while some may need reinforcement. Compromise is not about weakness; it is about directed influence. The “growing up” of management is sorely lacking in some of the smallest and largest organizations today. Address it with a real roadmap which includes an understanding of what matters and how compromise fits. Teach leaders how to survey the “land” and observe the signs. Ask them, “Do you hear the people sing?”
