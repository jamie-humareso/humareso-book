The difficulty of being a curmudgeon is deep and wide. As a rapidly-becoming older person, the temptation to slide into the glass being perpetually half-empty becomes more appealing. “Nothing” will ever be as good as it once was, and it is my job to highlight those failures through an unwelcome twelve-point treatise. Now while I don’t actually do this (please God, don’t have me do this!), I am struck by how many do. We look back on what once was with rose-colored glasses, focusing solely on how good life once was (lies, all lies).

I don’t think the intention is to become this. I also know that this is not an exclusive problem to the older generations. Recently, I heard a twenty-something share all the reasons why work sucks, people suck and how if everyone would just see things the way they did, then everything would work out much better for everyone. They were “current” and had their finger on the pulse of what everyone their age wants. Really? Have we really allowed the training wheels to come off the proverbial bike with this level of frustration and ineptitude? We cannot really believe we will make true progress through such a negative, inflexible, unapproachable demeanor.

And lest you think that negativity stymies collaboration and innovation leading to high performing cultures, it does not on its own. It is the entrenched stubbornness that pulls us under. Sometimes negative points of view challenge our approach and we need to take those perspectives into consideration. But inflexible stoicism about the negative truths is unhelpful. We won’t be able to advance our organizations through robust market penetration and creative problem solving with those stubborn curmudgeons blocking the way.

If you’ve slipped into such a dynamic or are living through it in your workplace, here are a few ways to address it:

**Decide you are fallible** – The tension we experience is oft-based upon our self-righteous conviction of infallible information. We know what we know and that is all there is to know. This belief exists in companies even though we say things like “innovation and advancement provide daily learning opportunities.” We don’t really believe it and we don’t act like we believe it. Listen, you don’t know everything. Say that out loud to yourself. Be free from the misdirected burden that you must be correct in every way. Put effort into understanding rather than posturing. In this way, when there is a truth to share, you would be seen as a contributor to success, even when the offering is a negative view of an issue.

**Rally the core** – Who can you be vulnerable with by asking for their view of your inputs? And if you have a compadre who thinks like you, then look for another person. Find a trusted resource who would be honest. And if you have made the environment unsafe because of your negativity, then start by owning that. Ask for forgiveness and then ask for their insight. Let the person know you are seeking to know and that you are endeavoring to change. It is not a guarantee that this person will jump right in to share, so it may take a bit of time before they share as you need them to.

**Practice being winsome and positive** – When you have operated in “curmudgeonness” for a while, your sensors need retraining. They need to be willfully redirected towards engaged relationship building and collaborative advancement. This is not the same as becoming “Susie Sunshine” but rather one who is welcome to participate in group meetings, developmental conversations, and enthusiastic business forecasting. The Oscar the Grouch vibe won’t get you there. Learning how to (re)function in a productive manner that is inclusive of all takes training. If you know someone who could help you reframe, ask them for help here as well.

Today is a great day to stop sitting in your office spouting negativity. It is a great day to change your frowning face and your down-on-the-world mentality. Today is a great day to get up and choose to engage openly and productively and be welcomed to do so. Being a curmudgeon doesn’t look good on anyone; stop trying to bring it into fashion.

Have you seen that hilarious commercial for the Aunts? Geico has put out some incredible commercials through the years, and this one is no exception. The concept of uninvited houseguests who also happen to be aunts of the homeowners is an approachable setup for the viewer. You may likely have an aunt like that. She comes into the home and comments on everything; it’s like a wicked game for these aunts. Our feelings of inadequacy rise to the surface. Ah, good times. To tap into such emotions, albeit tension and toxicity, brings a shared experience to life. That is the mark of a great commercial. Even though it’s been four years since its initial release, the commercial is still being played currently.

The shared experience of that commercial is fine when it’s at a distance. If we were really living that experience, however, the response would be much different. The annoyance of people pointing out your flaws and missteps would drive you out the door or to commit a felony. In the day-to-day, people in organizations tend to experience this type of interaction in a slow and steady manner. Chipping away at our self-esteem, we may sit despondent hoping that another interaction with colleagues wouldn’t be for another six months.

This cannot be the truth that we allow people to live in.

Fortitude is a great durable skill. Through encounters like these, our employees can learn how to become grounded, to filter out unnecessary distractions and to perform at the level the organization needs. But this is not an excuse for a poor work environment. The competency building needs not to be done on the backs of trauma and toxicity. In other words, the ends do not justify the means.

How else can we build fortitude in our staff? Firstly, expect the challenges and failures to come. Sounds simple, right? However, we don’t usually include in our onboarding protocols expectation management around failure. Work failure is a very real part of the experience at your organization, especially if it is promoting creativity, innovation and change.

By setting the tone for challenges to come, we promote coping mechanism development. How can an employee best train themselves in managing stress and in maintaining a forward-thinking perspective? We can provide resources in mindfulness, in relaxation, in mental acuity and toughness. All these areas can lead to a healthy development of fortitude in our staff.

It’s much easier to build support structures and cultivate adaptability when someone has invested internally in the hard work of fortitude development. Too often, organizations throw mentoring and resource groups at staff without providing a way for the individual to first invest in self. Those structures are difficult to maintain when the foundation is not there, or maybe even worse, if the “aunts” have been allowed to build their foundations.

Today is a great day to remove those Auntie Influencers; they are the ones who are now “expired!”

!Humareso Blog Posts-11-Blind Repetition-1We like to mess with things. Joaquin Phoenix delivered a visually stunning, if not uncomfortably magnificent, performance in 2019’s The Joker. He went on to win the Academy Award. His approach to a very well-known villain was fresh, psychologically complex, and disturbingly relatable. And so, what does Hollywood want to do? Capitalize on it with a sequel. Despite the fact that more times than not the original performs better, we press into the popularity of the character(s) and provide a weak storyline hoping to just have people show up out of nostalgia. Think of **Miss Congeniality 2**, **Legally Blonde 2**, **Ace Ventura 2**, any **Planet of the Apes** and more.

The safety in sequels is that the perceived risk is low. The content is shallow, limiting the storyline’s advancement. We think that having Lady Gaga added to a sequel is pushing the envelope, but it’s really a safe risk. She’s a known entity. The stretch isn’t there because the goal isn’t good storytelling; it’s a level of revenue. If a sequel can pull in 70% of the original, it’s a success. Putting something completely new into the market doesn’t usually yield as high a return. There is safety in the risk, but there is not necessarily advancement in any other area.

Work is no different. We like the success of a new account executive. The wins that the person is experiencing in sales becomes a blueprint for what we now want others in the department to do. It’s formulaic, without a depth of understanding as to why it’s working. How many of those wins are, at least in part, due to the personality of the account executive? Are those intangibles of persona influencing such wins? How will that be replicated beyond mirroring?

For all the conversation we’ve had for the last ten years (at least!) regarding skill development and competency advancement, most research still points to the lack of skill advancement as being a direct influencer to an increase in unemployment by the end of Q1 2025. Could it be that we want the safe risk of repetition rather than truly developing skills? Likely so.

What’s the difference? Mimicking is not skill advancement. Development through instruction, practice, coaching, and redirection leads to skill advancement. A distinct plan for individual development is truly building competencies in a contributor. When Lady Gaga joined part two of **The Joker**, the miss is not in her, but rather in the content of the development of the storyline, her character and in the collaboration with the original characters. But what has been discussed is her (it’s not her!).

We are quick to blame, and very often, it is not the process that gets blamed but a person. Just a Lady Gaga became a target for what was wrong with the sequel (whether the lack of story, the lack of acting ability or the odd way she was used, it was Gaga-centric), we lose willing contributors for development when they see organizations devouring their own. It is not likely they will want that kind of heat. “No thanks” while not spoken is the effort offered. Effectively, why be part of the sequel?

Lest you think all sequels are bad, they are not. **The Godfather, Part II** serves as a masterpiece in cinema, a truly remarkable feat considering the original Godfather is epic. The development and deepening of characters and storyline pushed the actors involved to deliver in familiar yet enlarging ways. The value in the original was not merely about its commercial success but in the way it grounded a variety of actors in their craft. They were able to grow, express and evolve in that sequel.

The form is not the goal, but in the developmental, advancing function of multifaceted talent in an emerging story (market). When we merely work on form, we get **The Godfather, Part III**. And I don’t have enough time to talk about that monstrous disappointment…

!Humareso Blog Posts-9-Shadow DancingHave you been fascinated with having special powers? As a kid comic book enthusiast, I would spend hours reading the adventures of various superheroes. When those stories came to life on the small or big screen, I was front and center (still am, truth be told). Steve Austin, The Six Million Dollar Man, was a stud. He was the world’s first bionic man. For those of a certain age, do you remember this mid-1970’s TV Show intro? “Steve Austin. A man barely alive. Gentlemen, we can rebuild him. We have the technology. We have the capability to build the world’s first bionic man…Steve Austin will be that man. We can make him better than he was before. Better…Stronger…Faster.” YES! I was hooked. He was built to be the best.

We may have fallen into a misdirected expectation of such a build for our employees. Obviously, there is no $6,000,000 budget per employee for such development (wouldn’t that be nice?). However, do we expect our employees to behave and produce as if that level of budget has been invested? Now before you shake your head no, think about it. How many times have you thought or said, “Why does {this person} act like this?” or more likely, “What is wrong with {this person}?” Admit it; you have.

What if the truth is that the person is operating at the level of awareness and education given? Our expectation of someone without confirmation of investment to that learning level or self-awareness factor is our fault, not theirs, right? Let’s pretend that I yelled at one of my children (imagine it…never happened…*fingers crossed*) for doing something that, in my opinion, they should have known not to do. Those big, beautiful eyes would look up at me in confusion. And that child would be right if I had not shared previously why to avoid or to act upon something. The knowledge would have been helpful. It may not have kept them from doing the opposite anyway (ah, kids), but that would be a different conversation.

And we may jump to shouting or scaring a child when they go running into the street. We go into quick-response protection mode. That’s not what we’re speaking of here. This is about development. This is about those competencies such as critical thinking, project management, time management and creative approaches. We often have this expectation of our staff with very little investment in their curation.

Our excuses will be that we don’t have a budget or time. We might be okay with the shadow of activity rather than the reality of productivity because of these constraints. Fine, but look at the performance appraisals of various team members. How many have ratings based upon skills, aptitudes and knowledge that the organization has not helped to foster? Be honest. Look at the real investment of learning that has occurred, not just the first-day sharing of user name and password for the LMS.

It is not going to be true that every organization is failing at this. It isn’t. But it’s worth looking at every so often.

For many of us, our organizations are cutting back. Trying to walk into Finance with a list of demands might be met with disdain. This idea of doing more with less is not a new concept to human resource practitioners. We know that we will still need to train and develop staff regardless. Let’s not grow weary of doing so, even if we don’t have that $6 million budget. We can’t build Steve Austin, okay, but we can build Marcy, Tim, Joann and Diego. We can work with what we have more deliberately. We have the technology. Our smartphones alone have more technology in them than the computers used to build the Six Million Dollar Man. Use those to start. We have the capability.

!Humareso Blog Posts-6-PromisesThe wooing of talent takes skill, determination, availability…and a bit of luck. We don’t like that luck part. It’s out of our control. I can make myself available. I can improve my skills in rapport development, full spectrum sourcing, and job marketing. I can put the dedicated time in. But catching someone at the right place, right time and in the right mood? That isn’t in our control.

The default for some recruiting pros and hiring managers is to overpromise in order to manufacture luck. Creative career mapping opportunities are well-delivered but based upon no actual history of offering such options to existing staff. A commitment to knowledge deepening is espoused, but often there is no time or budget committed to this endeavor. Warm affirmations regarding the company values are wrapped like a blanket around the candidate, but the existing staff have yet to find that blanket.

The lies that are told (yes, I am calling them lies) lay a foundation that requires an all-or-nothing response from the candidate. You’ve given them everything you can – money, culture, opportunity promises – and that sets up extremes. If the candidate accepts these conditions and joins the team, only to then find out rather quickly that no such opportunities are ready to be presented (nor may they ever be), then the quick departure occurs. Hiring managers return to scrambling to fill the once-again open role (usually citing the previous person to be a “just didn’t fit” employee) where they will return to promising experiences unlikely to happen.

On the other hand, if the candidate calls the bluff and asks to speak to a current employee or two who are doing the same or similar work (yes, that happens at times), recruiters know they’ve been had. How could they let the candidate ask about these, at best, exaggerated opportunities to the current team? Won’t the staff finish that conversation with the candidate and march directly to the manager to ask when their developmental options will begin? The all-or-nothing is setup and it’s impossible to unwind.

Recruiters and hiring managers need to stand firm in following some basic principles of talent wooing:

First, speak the truth. Offer what is, not what you might hope will be, unless you clearly define the difference. It’s okay to say that, with the potential addition of this particular candidate, we hope to be able to expand our educational investment opportunities. We don’t have a timeline on that, but that is our clear hope, though not present today. Candidates appreciate the truth. They don’t want to feel snookered.

Secondly, anything that is offered in the interviewing process is up for grabs in the accountability game. A candidate should be able to ask when they might expect an update, should they accept a position with the organization, as to when these pieces hoped for are planned or are happening. Open-ended hopes will likely become closed-ended bitterness within the first six months of employment. By establishing timelines for check-in wrapped in accountable practices for delivery, the new employee has a clearly defined expectation to hold you to.

Thirdly, never underestimate the power of a realistic job preview. Offer the candidate to speak to employees who may not be part of the decision-making process. In fact, have the candidate speak to a champion as well as one who may not be overly enamored of the company (don’t tell me they aren’t in your company; they are). This is the most holistic view they can get. By putting those conversations forward as an option in the process, the candidate gets a strong sense that you’re not trying to hide behind something. Proactive transparency is attractive to candidates.

Promises aren’t the enemy; it’s the delivery and the follow-through. Can you confidently stand behind what you have just promised? Is it a real possibility or is it wishful thinking? You know which one it is; don’t lie to yourself, and certainly don’t lie to the candidate.
