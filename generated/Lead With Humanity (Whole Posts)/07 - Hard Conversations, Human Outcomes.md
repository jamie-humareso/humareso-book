The difficulty of being a curmudgeon is deep and wide. As a rapidly-becoming older person, the temptation to slide into the glass being perpetually half-empty becomes more appealing. “Nothing” will ever be as good as it once was, and it is my job to highlight those failures through an unwelcome twelve-point treatise. Now while I don’t actually do this (please God, don’t have me do this!), I am struck by how many do. We look back on what once was with rose-colored glasses, focusing solely on how good life once was (lies, all lies).

I don’t think the intention is to become this. I also know that this is not an exclusive problem to the older generations. Recently, I heard a twenty-something share all the reasons why work sucks, people suck and how if everyone would just see things the way they did, then everything would work out much better for everyone. They were “current” and had their finger on the pulse of what everyone their age wants. Really? Have we really allowed the training wheels to come off the proverbial bike with this level of frustration and ineptitude? We cannot really believe we will make true progress through such a negative, inflexible, unapproachable demeanor.

And lest you think that negativity stymies collaboration and innovation leading to high performing cultures, it does not on its own. It is the entrenched stubbornness that pulls us under. Sometimes negative points of view challenge our approach and we need to take those perspectives into consideration. But inflexible stoicism about the negative truths is unhelpful. We won’t be able to advance our organizations through robust market penetration and creative problem solving with those stubborn curmudgeons blocking the way.

If you’ve slipped into such a dynamic or are living through it in your workplace, here are a few ways to address it:

**Decide you are fallible** – The tension we experience is oft-based upon our self-righteous conviction of infallible information. We know what we know and that is all there is to know. This belief exists in companies even though we say things like “innovation and advancement provide daily learning opportunities.” We don’t really believe it and we don’t act like we believe it. Listen, you don’t know everything. Say that out loud to yourself. Be free from the misdirected burden that you must be correct in every way. Put effort into understanding rather than posturing. In this way, when there is a truth to share, you would be seen as a contributor to success, even when the offering is a negative view of an issue.

**Rally the core** – Who can you be vulnerable with by asking for their view of your inputs? And if you have a compadre who thinks like you, then look for another person. Find a trusted resource who would be honest. And if you have made the environment unsafe because of your negativity, then start by owning that. Ask for forgiveness and then ask for their insight. Let the person know you are seeking to know and that you are endeavoring to change. It is not a guarantee that this person will jump right in to share, so it may take a bit of time before they share as you need them to.

**Practice being winsome and positive** – When you have operated in “curmudgeonness” for a while, your sensors need retraining. They need to be willfully redirected towards engaged relationship building and collaborative advancement. This is not the same as becoming “Susie Sunshine” but rather one who is welcome to participate in group meetings, developmental conversations, and enthusiastic business forecasting. The Oscar the Grouch vibe won’t get you there. Learning how to (re)function in a productive manner that is inclusive of all takes training. If you know someone who could help you reframe, ask them for help here as well.

Today is a great day to stop sitting in your office spouting negativity. It is a great day to change your frowning face and your down-on-the-world mentality. Today is a great day to get up and choose to engage openly and productively and be welcomed to do so. Being a curmudgeon doesn’t look good on anyone; stop trying to bring it into fashion.

The only way forward is progress, a rousing sentiment. But I have seen the opposite be the way forward—regress. Falling behind, disastrous choices, infighting, broken processes…shall I continue? We likely all have experienced some of this. Do we forego the pithy sentiment about progression?

The objective motivator is the individual contribution by each, not by all. Sentiment becomes watered down when it’s generalized to all. We all know that “Hang in There” cat poster (thank you to that awesome show, The Middle, for memorializing it for posterity). When delivered to the whole, it is simply positive sentiment without real direction. However, when delivered to an individual, it becomes personal. What do I need to do in order to hang in there? The individual delivery is meant to be thought-provoking and encouraging.

When it comes to progress, the same objective can be offered specifically. The only way forward is progress as an individualized objective pushes the receiver to consider what that person can do as well as what is needed in order to do so. That’s progress. Walking into a department and saying, “Do Better” is generalized. A manager should not expect a team member to rise to the occasion after such a broad admonition. The path of least resistance is to say to one’s self, “I am doing the better. It’s everyone else.” And that is most often the end of the line of “motivation.”

Instead, if a department needs to do better, seek to address the individuals. The opening mandate to all may set the stage for what’s to come, but it’s the one-on-one dialogue that will bring to light those reflective considerations.

“Joe, the organization needs us to do better. What do you see as being an area of improvement we should address? How can you help to address that suggestion, and what will that take for you to do so?” This might be the purest way to start an individual check-in. And lest you think that each person will automatically say, “Oh, it’s me. I am the problem and will change my evil ways immediately,” (we’re so bitter, aren’t we?) it may take a moment or two for someone to get beyond the reason why it’s actually Marty’s fault that everything is crap. With some gentle, consistent questions, Joe will begin to think personally. “Well, Marty is part of the problem. I can see that we’ve become less motivated to do a great job. We have become okay with a passable job.” Those we-statements are code for I-statements, often done due to a lack of organizational trust or out of fear from previous interactions. Meet that person in those illuminating moments by affirming the perspective and asking to understand more deeply.

It is not easy for a first-time supervisor to draw out such reflection from a team. It takes practice. If you are a first-time manager, give yourself some grace.

And to those of you who get asked about progression and how you can participate, participate. Talk to your supervisor. Be gracious, thoughtful, and innovative. You do not need to be a doormat to do that. Focus on what you can do first. Or, I guess you could respond like Axl from **The Middle**, “…Together we are awesome. But alone, only I am still awesome.”

!Humareso Blog Posts-9-Waiting for a girl like you (1).jpeg)In the movie **Life Itself**, Oscar Issac’s character, Will, has a great line about waiting for the right moment to ask out Abby (Olivia Wilde). He is waiting for the right moment because when he starts this relationship with her, he is all in. There won’t be any turning back. He wants to ask her out at the right moment to set that tone from the onset. He’s waiting with a purpose.

And we might be working with some of those “waiters” as well. Over 90% of Gen Z and Millennial employees would like to change jobs this year. The percentage, however, falls dramatically when pushed as to whether they really will.

The economic environment is affecting the confidence that our employees have about moving on. Most feel that it’s necessary to move on as it will likely open doors for higher pay and greater responsibility. There are varying studies showing different results regarding compensation differentiation based on staying or leaving. For instance, a recent analysis done by Sentinel Pay Analytics for an organization with about 23,000 employees showed no difference in pay levels between those who’ve stayed and those who boomeranged back to the company. That’s not the case in all organizations, but banking on it in the current economic state appears too risky.

“The number one thing people are craving right now is stability—especially in their workplaces,” said Ella F. Washington, PhD, an organizational psychologist and professor of practice at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business. This jives with what many of you are facing. And while employees may have interest in leaving as soon as they feel confident to do so, we don’t have to accept that fate. Organizations can take steps to change that trajectory.

Own dialogue – Look to engage with people…on purpose. For managers and human resources practitioners, the no news is good news philosophy has affected our intentionality with our staff. We stay distant and we chat only about work process or product. These heavily transactional conversations cause a utilitarian vibe to be felt by our employees. Engage with work-related conversations, of course, but also recognize that performance-based dialogue includes skill development in relationally areas, too. Work with your team by talking to your team.

Encourage innovation – Too often we’re too busy. We cannot take the time to foster creativity because we have deadlines or quotas to meet. We keep our eyes on only the finish line, and we fail to meet people in innovative advancements. Your teams have ideas. They want processes to be better. They see the value in what they are doing, but they also want to influence what they are doing. They want to make a change for the good of the whole, truly. We may be tempted to minimize creativity because of that one time it didn’t work out. Innovation leaves room for failure so don’t be surprised that you will have to try again. It is not a reason to stop pushing forward.

Offer transparency in moderation – Organizations that function fully in transparency – sharing every data point possible – may unintentionally foster fear. When sales fall slightly, or when expenses increase over one month, we might have to handle worries from the team. This is not to say that transparency is bad; actually, quite the opposite. Employees feel more tied to the organization when they have a level of understanding as well as the opportunity to ask deeper questions. Allow for that while keeping considerate of how much data is going out.

It's not too late to keep some people who may be thinking about a move, delayed as it may be. The current economy might give organizations a false sense of security. You may not be doing as well as you think just because turnover is down. The economic stagnation, presidential election, high inflation, and other considerations could be affecting the status quo nature of employee retention.

And to be clear, there are still employees leaving their roles now. We can’t look at data so hard and fast in all categories. The trend is not universal, nor should it be. Either way, taking a look at how you might influence a change in direction is worth your time.

What if one decision alters the course of your life? What if it’s multiple decisions? Chance encounters, missing out on a job opening, picking one bar over another to hang on a Friday night…all of these can limit or expand whom you meet, or they can change circumstances from which you make decisions. Not to give it all away, but yes, one decision can alter the course of your life.

In the movie Sliding Doors, Gwyneth Paltrow’s life vacillates between two different paths merely based on whether she made her train home from work or not. There is one particular relationship that hangs on that train ride. Ultimately, there is a convergence of timelines and relationships. In real life, you may feel that option doesn’t exist. If you miss it, you blew it.

Regret over these lost opportunities plagues many in our workplaces, our communities, and even our homes. “If only I had…” is a refrain that plays in the minds of many throughout any given day. It is overwhelmingly restricting and can cause some to spiral downward as they sit in that regret. No one is alone in these perceived missed opportunities, but the answer isn’t in the mourning of them.

Consider the benefit of what could have been thinking. It is a rabbit hole of rehashing conversations, reconsidering how circumstances should have played out, and rehearsing better responses. It is an endless cycle of lack. And once lack becomes the central focus, our mental, emotional, and physical health can trend downward.

Let’s affirm one thing to start – you are right where you are supposed to be. Let’s state that again. Today, you are where you are. You may want differently. You may wish you had chosen wiser or with more intention, but here you are. Accepting that today you are where you are supposed to be is freeing. It frees you up to healthily look at what could be.

The shroud of regret blinds us to the whole picture and to the context of what is really in front of us. In 2016, The Atlantic published an article that explored this idea of regret costs based upon one main premise – *“The tradeoff for moving our own pieces is that sometimes we make mistakes, and we have to live with them.”* Accepting this basic truth is the start to a healthier approach to what is and to what could be next.

Your life is not disappointing because you did not take one job over another. Early on in my career, I had the opportunity to work for **TV Guide** (if you don’t know what this is, I weep for you). Looking back on it, I should have said yes. I turned the role down. It did not have all of the things I wanted it to have. I was short-sighted and immature. I can see that today. However, I am not supposed to live in regret and disappointment over thirty years later. I ought to be able to look at it, see it for what it was (a learning opportunity), and then move on.
