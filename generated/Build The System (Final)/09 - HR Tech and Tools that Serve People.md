# HR Tech and Tools that Serve People

<!-- Source: Ten Years: John Baldino Celebrates Humareso’s Impact in Human Resources | 2022-08-01 17:30:00 | https://blog.humareso.com/john-baldino-celebrates-ten-years-of-humareso | john-baldino-celebrates-ten-years-of-humareso -->
In the song, “Ten Years” by Paul Simon, he pens:

*Ten years come and gone so fast**I might as well have been dreaming**Sunny days have burned a path**Across another season**A fortune rises to the sky*

It’s as if Mr. Simon is inside my mind on this special day. Ten years ago, Humareso began. I remember sitting at breakfast with a business owner the day after I left my VP role with a national lender. He sat across from me and asked, “So what are you going to do now?” For a moment, I heard that question reverberate in my subconscious. My most honest answer was, “I have no idea.” Instead, what spilled out was a business conviction. Companies did not have all the resources necessary to provide functional organizational drive and impactful cultural change.

I looked across at my breakfast date and shared a vision of businesses with innovation as a core component to every job description while maintaining thoughtfulness to each compliance nuance offered through legislation and case law. My experience in two handfuls of industries showed me that there was a best way to engage with people in spite of varied technical skill and geographic considerations. There were universal truths. And the markets were screaming for them to be incorporated into every organization from start-ups to enterprise corporations.

The entrepreneurial spirit had been dormant inside of me for too long and this was the right time to step out. And so, when that breakfast companion finished having eggs and listening to me for almost an hour, he said, “Done. Let’s get started with my company.” I had Humareso’s first client.

Emboldened by proof that my idea had legs, I set out to talk to other companies within my sphere of influence. And before long, I was working on a full docket (and then some) of clients of various industries who wanted to know what good human resources should look like. There were hints at some of them; one had a wonderful HR Director who was trying to do great HR, but had a CEO who thought he knew better. When he asked me to come in to help, he regretted that decision quickly. Most of my time was spent with him reshaping how he thought things should go and figuring out where his mode of critical thinking was born. He saw the light, and again, it was confirmation that this road for Humareso was the right one.

These ten years later, I can look back at the paths worn by travel and faded by the sun. The gains have far outweighed the gaps. The Humareso team has left a mark of richness, integrity and creativity that I could never have achieved without them. I could not express my gratitude any deeper than by sharing my heartfelt and tearful thanks (yes, I am still a crier…). To have been entrusted with the development of so many within our organization so that they, too, can transform others is core to my credo of sacrificial leadership. You have built Humareso with me.

Fostering deeper business relationships, speaking at dozens of conferences and events, writing hundreds of blogs, partnering with other HR and technology organizations have all been highlights through these years. The love that Twitter gave me early on as an HR pro helped to propel the message of Humareso faster than I had anticipated. By year 3, we were operating as if it were year 5 (based on my projections), and year 10 has us continuing to be a couple of years ahead, even with the updates. Our HRO program began winning awards. The work that we are doing is rich and meaningful. We have impacted tens of thousands of employees. That is not a number to take lightly; I am humbled by just the thought of it let alone the notes of gratitude we’ve gotten through these years.

I’m not sure I could have imagined today when I first started. My family encouraged me towards it; they encouraged me away from my fears and into the greatness they saw coming. I have been broken and blessed, which is a path for all of us. For it is in that reality that truth comes shining through – the things you can count on, the beliefs that will truly guide. And as I sit here with ten years of Humareso success to celebrate, I know that there is still more to come. The sun will continue to show those paths, and the fortune found in deepening relationships and positively changed organizations will be the legacy I strive towards. Cheers to Humareso and to all of you for making it so.

Afresh. That’s the word for 2023. Yup, I’ve decided. Feel free to use the word in sentences throughout the year. “Hmm, I am tired of these clothes. Maybe if I pair things afresh, I won’t hate everything I own in my closet.” “The marriage is stale. The relationship needs some life afresh.” “While I appreciate the dinner you’ve made, looking at your recipes afresh would be a welcome change.” (Let me know how that one goes)

There are many ways to use the word. It’s applicable at home or work, with friends or family, and for pleasure or for business. It’s the starting point for change. A review of what’s happening and how to revitalize it, whether by approach or adoption. It’s the challenge to look at what’s coming up and infuse enthusiasm into it. Afresh is intentional.

When we look at work process, for instance, how can we see it afresh? The complacency that settles in due to the routine of work, whether onsite, at home or remotely, affects what we think of work. We can become stagnant and hate the fact that we’ve become stagnant.

The joy of work is different than being happy at work. Ouch. That one might sting a bit. We don’t mind being proactive at work if we’re happy, but if we’re unhappy or marginally connected at best, then we don’t have the energy or desire. We want to be inspired first. Someone needs to come along, usually a manager or business leader, and help me get happy (again, if ever). Once that happens, then I am most willing to approach work afresh.

Truth be told, that’s not likely to happen. Your happiness is not a commodity that managers trade well. Many managers are working out their own happiness, and the ebb and flow of emotion is not a competency taught or practiced in most (if not, any) courses of study. Why would we place such a burden into the hands of management? Further, why would I want a manager to have a say in my happiness?

This is where seeing joy afresh is helpful. Joy is mine. I get to focus on this state of being, distinctly different than happiness, and determine where my stability comes from. When I approach work process afresh, I don’t want to manufacture a feeling, but rather, I want to operate out of what’s coming up in me. My joy is mine. I am anchored in truths that encourage joy in my heart and mind. Now, when innovation and creativity are asked of me, I am eager to do so because it means something to me as a result of who I know I am. I have great joy in that. Happiness comes and goes, but joy doesn’t have to.

The challenge of joy is that we want to feel it every day. Listen, I love my three kids. There’s nothing I wouldn’t do for them. They are remarkable adults and make me proud at every turn. BUT, they don’t live with me anymore. They are off in college, grad school and beyond, making their own way, living in their joy, even when they don’t feel happy (it’s finals time!). I don’t live daily in state of their presence, but it does not diminish my joy. I may miss them. I may not be happy at moments because of that; however, my joy in who they are and how I’ve been allowed to be a part of that truth is mine, regardless of the circumstances. That’s how joy should operate in your life. Take the time to look at joy afresh.

Our organizations need us to push for fresh looks. The messaging of 2022 included a push to bring your whole self to work. Some of you might not be excited about that, not because work shouldn’t ask for that (that’s an entirely different blog post!), but because you haven’t been thrilled with who you are. That’s okay. Today is the day to approach yourself afresh. It’s not about resolutions, but it’s about commitment, habits to encourage those commitments and surrounding yourself with people who will love you through those commitments.

The next year is yours. Every year is yours, though. Don’t allow another day to go by without reflection and a path towards patterned change in your life. Yes, work needs you to be your healthiest. Your relationships need that, too. You need you to be your stabilized best. It’s time for life afresh.

When you’re five years old, a wedding cake looks massive. It’s not to say that at six feet, three inches, these cakes are minuscule now, but as a young boy, I was a ring bearer for the first time at five years old. I got to do that job a couple of times, actually. And one of my favorite parts of it all was the dessert. The sweet table filled with various cookies, mini-cakes, and other sugary dreams had my already large eyes bugging out of my head. However, the many-tiered wedding cake was a full stop for me. Yes, please, and multiple slices.

I can’t help but think of that four- or five-tiered expression of sweet joy when I consider HR tech stacking in the workplace. And let’s be honest, it’s not because of the sugary sweetness of technology that I think of it. Rather, it’s much more about the stability of the cake as each layer supports the one above. Healthy, viable tech stacking in the workplace is built deliberately and supportively to the main functions to be achieved.

You may have tech stacking at your workplace and not even know it. For instance, if you use an applicant tracking system (ATS) to receive responses to your job postings, whether resumes or applications, then that is step one in the most basic “workplace wedding cakes.” The widest volume of people interactions happens at this entry point. Consider how many people apply for open roles at your organization. Certainly, not all of them will become employees, but the repository may have four times as many applications as employees, if not a much higher multiplier. That’s a wide pool to manage to affirm candidate experience, company branding, and hiring manager accountability. There are automatic triggers in communication to applicants and internal stakeholders to the process that should be in place. The flow of information is crucial at this stage.

Perhaps your company adds a tier in employee assessments, whether job-related to process or culturally considerate to personality or motivations, to this tech stack. If you use screenings of various kinds, that layer would sit on the ATS. Those online assessments might get activated automatically because of a certain level hit in the candidate selection process, or perhaps you manually request them online with the information then flowing into the applicant process.

The next layer is added when an offer of employment is requested, delivered, and accepted. The human resources information system (HRIS) picks up with that acceptance and electronically distributes the onboarding documentation. The new hire gets to complete the W4, I9, state and local required documents along with direct deposit, employee handbook receipt, and other pertinent policy advisements. For some of you, you are still doing all that was listed above in paper form. Oh, I am so sorry. There is an easier way, honestly, and it doesn’t break the bank to do so.

Many payroll systems function as an HRIS (or at least an HRMS – human resources management system) to electronically distribute and store employee onboarding documentation. That tier in the HR tech stack allows for monitoring in the completion process to be done remotely. With more organizations having employees work in a geographically distributed role, handling HR processes technologically from anywhere adds positively to the employee experience as well as affirms organizational relevance in the eyes of the new hire.

We’ve only built the first three layers of the “workplace wedding cake,” but there are other tiers to be added. The more robust of a hiring or employee life-cycle process, the more a company needs to develop a specific HR technology stack flow.

Start with what you have access to currently. Look at the options and features that you may have as part of your current contract. Why aren’t they activated? What fears are there to do so? Who owns the activation – should it be someone in-house or do you need an external HR project manager to get it set up correctly?

Sit with your team and sketch out this cake. How many layers to start? (Parts of the process to handle) What flavor of cake? (Think technological representation of the values of the company) What icing? (Think organizational branding) What decorations? (Think who gets to be involved and what they represent about the company) And the best part might be the taste-testing (Think demos with a few technology vendors) so that you can see what options make the most sense for your plans.

Tech stacking isn’t scary, nor should it make you sad. It just requires some consideration, planning, and activation. These are the bones of what HR does regularly, anyway.
