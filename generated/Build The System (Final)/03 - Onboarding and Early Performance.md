# Onboarding and Early Performance

<!-- Source: Dreams | 2023-07-05 13:30:00 | https://blog.humareso.com/dreams | dreams -->
There has always been an appeal to the Academy Awards for me. To this day, I still envision myself holding that Oscar for Best Actor or Best Supporting Actor (I am not picky), giving thanks to those who have helped me realize this goal. It’s not because I want to be a mega-huge superstar but because I enjoy acting, and I know I have the talent for it. I can’t sing, so there won’t be musicals in my future, but a good dramatic role that I could sink my teeth into is right up my alley. Who knows? Now that I have put this out into the world, someone might offer me a spot in their next major motion picture! (I won’t be waiting by the phone)

The truth is, many of us have unrealized dreams. Your dreams and hopes are special, even if they do not come to fruition. If the Oscar isn’t handed to me, my life is not a failure. I am grounded enough to know that there are more components to my life than one fantasy. While it would be fun, it won’t make me any more “something.” I am something now.

You are dealing with your own dreams. Are you “less than” because it hasn’t happened or happened yet? How are you defining yourself, and how are you defining success? The rub here is that our stability is oft influenced by visual reminders of what we don’t have. Spend any time on social media, and you will be convinced that your life is not where it ought to be. You aren’t as fabulous as the chiseled, fit bodies flexing on Instagram Stories. You aren’t as brilliant as those teaching LinkedIn Live webinars. You aren’t as “something” as what you see. The visual reminders can be debilitating.

Firstly, do you have the dreams you have because of the pressure from outside cues or is it because of your own internal motivations and desires? Authentic aspirations are exciting, motivating and captivating. That does not mean they are easy to achieve, but the motivations are genuine. Instead, if the aspirations are because of what you see, you may live too much in comparison. Unhealth can set in. Those pressured aspirations can set you up to fail.

Secondly, motivation towards your dreams isn’t about being preached to, but rather to be encouraged towards. There are those making a living by berating you into go-go-go mentality of achievement. Listen, I am all for some directed push. I can be lazy. I can grow tired, so I do need a few to remind me of the dreams I am working towards. Those relationships are dear to me. That’s a far cry from the half dozen podcasts you might be listening to where your existence is questioned at every turn. Those people should not serve to minimize or belittle you. If they rightly motivate, then stick with them. If you feel like a piece of crap after you listen, stop listening.

A final thought is that delayed is not denied. Today might be the day your dreams are actualized, but it might happen farther the road. Keep walking towards it. Again, it’s not a total failure if it never materializes, but you don’t know what might happen in the future. Resigning yourself to maintaining a “less than” frame of mind can lead to poor self-esteem and worth, even to mental health strains. You are still traveling along the road. You are not there yet. Keep walking.

In the past month, I have heard from at least a handful of people who are saddened by what’s not yet true of them. They are struggling to see the value in what they’re learning along the way. If this is you, use the sadness. It might jolt you into more focused activity towards those aspirations. The sadness might give you reason to review and to redefine, if necessary, those dreams you have. The sadness is a tool, not a state of being, in this perspective.

When I win that Academy Award, I will be thanking those who helped me to run after what I said I wanted to run after. I will feel satisfied with the accomplishment, and I should. However, the realized dream doesn’t mean I am done. There are other dreams to birth to fruition. I am an active being; so are you. And so are those you work with. We’re all running after it. It’s better to be a partner to as many as possible. Realizing this should influence your compassionate view of family, co-workers, even your boss! We all have dreams. What’s your dream?

. Steve Austin, The Six Million Dollar Man, was a stud. He was the world’s first bionic man. For those of a certain age, do you remember this mid-1970’s TV Show intro? “Steve Austin. A man barely alive. Gentlemen, we can rebuild him. We have the technology. We have the capability to build the world’s first bionic man…Steve Austin will be that man. We can make him better than he was before. Better…Stronger…Faster.” YES! I was hooked. He was built to be the best.

We may have fallen into a misdirected expectation of such a build for our employees. Obviously, there is no $6,000,000 budget per employee for such development (wouldn’t that be nice?). However, do we expect our employees to behave and produce as if that level of budget has been invested? Now before you shake your head no, think about it. How many times have you thought or said, “Why does {this person} act like this?” or more likely, “What is wrong with {this person}?” Admit it; you have.

What if the truth is that the person is operating at the level of awareness and education given? Our expectation of someone without confirmation of investment to that learning level or self-awareness factor is our fault, not theirs, right? Let’s pretend that I yelled at one of my children (imagine it…never happened…*fingers crossed*) for doing something that, in my opinion, they should have known not to do. Those big, beautiful eyes would look up at me in confusion. And that child would be right if I had not shared previously why to avoid or to act upon something. The knowledge would have been helpful. It may not have kept them from doing the opposite anyway (ah, kids), but that would be a different conversation.

And we may jump to shouting or scaring a child when they go running into the street. We go into quick-response protection mode. That’s not what we’re speaking of here. This is about development. This is about those competencies such as critical thinking, project management, time management and creative approaches. We often have this expectation of our staff with very little investment in their curation.

Our excuses will be that we don’t have a budget or time. We might be okay with the shadow of activity rather than the reality of productivity because of these constraints. Fine, but look at the performance appraisals of various team members. How many have ratings based upon skills, aptitudes and knowledge that the organization has not helped to foster? Be honest. Look at the real investment of learning that has occurred, not just the first-day sharing of user name and password for the LMS.

It is not going to be true that every organization is failing at this. It isn’t. But it’s worth looking at every so often.

For many of us, our organizations are cutting back. Trying to walk into Finance with a list of demands might be met with disdain. This idea of doing more with less is not a new concept to human resource practitioners. We know that we will still need to train and develop staff regardless. Let’s not grow weary of doing so, even if we don’t have that $6 million budget. We can’t build Steve Austin, okay, but we can build Marcy, Tim, Joann and Diego. We can work with what we have more deliberately. We have the technology. Our smartphones alone have more technology in them than the computers used to build the Six Million Dollar Man. Use those to start. We have the capability.

and provide a weak storyline hoping to just have people show up out of nostalgia. Think of **Miss Congeniality 2**, **Legally Blonde 2**, **Ace Ventura 2**, any **Planet of the Apes** and more.

The safety in sequels is that the perceived risk is low. The content is shallow, limiting the storyline’s advancement. We think that having Lady Gaga added to a sequel is pushing the envelope, but it’s really a safe risk. She’s a known entity. The stretch isn’t there because the goal isn’t good storytelling; it’s a level of revenue. If a sequel can pull in 70% of the original, it’s a success. Putting something completely new into the market doesn’t usually yield as high a return. There is safety in the risk, but there is not necessarily advancement in any other area.

Work is no different. We like the success of a new account executive. The wins that the person is experiencing in sales becomes a blueprint for what we now want others in the department to do. It’s formulaic, without a depth of understanding as to why it’s working. How many of those wins are, at least in part, due to the personality of the account executive? Are those intangibles of persona influencing such wins? How will that be replicated beyond mirroring?

For all the conversation we’ve had for the last ten years (at least!) regarding skill development and competency advancement, most research still points to the lack of skill advancement as being a direct influencer to an increase in unemployment by the end of Q1 2025. Could it be that we want the safe risk of repetition rather than truly developing skills? Likely so.

What’s the difference? Mimicking is not skill advancement. Development through instruction, practice, coaching, and redirection leads to skill advancement. A distinct plan for individual development is truly building competencies in a contributor. When Lady Gaga joined part two of **The Joker**, the miss is not in her, but rather in the content of the development of the storyline, her character and in the collaboration with the original characters. But what has been discussed is her (it’s not her!).

We are quick to blame, and very often, it is not the process that gets blamed but a person. Just a Lady Gaga became a target for what was wrong with the sequel (whether the lack of story, the lack of acting ability or the odd way she was used, it was Gaga-centric), we lose willing contributors for development when they see organizations devouring their own. It is not likely they will want that kind of heat. “No thanks” while not spoken is the effort offered. Effectively, why be part of the sequel?

Lest you think all sequels are bad, they are not. **The Godfather, Part II** serves as a masterpiece in cinema, a truly remarkable feat considering the original Godfather is epic. The development and deepening of characters and storyline pushed the actors involved to deliver in familiar yet enlarging ways. The value in the original was not merely about its commercial success but in the way it grounded a variety of actors in their craft. They were able to grow, express and evolve in that sequel.

The form is not the goal, but in the developmental, advancing function of multifaceted talent in an emerging story (market). When we merely work on form, we get **The Godfather, Part III**. And I don’t have enough time to talk about that monstrous disappointment…

<!-- Source: The Grouch: Getting Rid of the Curmudgeon in You | 2025-03-06 17:43:32 | https://blog.humareso.com/the-grouch-getting-rid-of-the-curmudgeon-in-you | the-grouch-getting-rid-of-the-curmudgeon-in-you -->
The Grouch

The difficulty of being a curmudgeon is deep and wide. As a rapidly-becoming older person, the temptation to slide into the glass being perpetually half-empty becomes more appealing. “Nothing” will ever be as good as it once was, and it is my job to highlight those failures through an unwelcome twelve-point treatise. Now while I don’t actually do this (please God, don’t have me do this!), I am struck by how many do. We look back on what once was with rose-colored glasses, focusing solely on how good life once was (lies, all lies).

I don’t think the intention is to become this. I also know that this is not an exclusive problem to the older generations. Recently, I heard a twenty-something share all the reasons why work sucks, people suck and how if everyone would just see things the way they did, then everything would work out much better for everyone. They were “current” and had their finger on the pulse of what everyone their age wants. Really? Have we really allowed the training wheels to come off the proverbial bike with this level of frustration and ineptitude? We cannot really believe we will make true progress through such a negative, inflexible, unapproachable demeanor.

And lest you think that negativity stymies collaboration and innovation leading to high performing cultures, it does not on its own. It is the entrenched stubbornness that pulls us under. Sometimes negative points of view challenge our approach and we need to take those perspectives into consideration. But inflexible stoicism about the negative truths is unhelpful. We won’t be able to advance our organizations through robust market penetration and creative problem solving with those stubborn curmudgeons blocking the way.

If you’ve slipped into such a dynamic or are living through it in your workplace, here are a few ways to address it:

**Decide you are fallible** – The tension we experience is oft-based upon our self-righteous conviction of infallible information. We know what we know and that is all there is to know. This belief exists in companies even though we say things like “innovation and advancement provide daily learning opportunities.” We don’t really believe it and we don’t act like we believe it. Listen, you don’t know everything. Say that out loud to yourself. Be free from the misdirected burden that you must be correct in every way. Put effort into understanding rather than posturing. In this way, when there is a truth to share, you would be seen as a contributor to success, even when the offering is a negative view of an issue.

**Rally the core** – Who can you be vulnerable with by asking for their view of your inputs? And if you have a compadre who thinks like you, then look for another person. Find a trusted resource who would be honest. And if you have made the environment unsafe because of your negativity, then start by owning that. Ask for forgiveness and then ask for their insight. Let the person know you are seeking to know and that you are endeavoring to change. It is not a guarantee that this person will jump right in to share, so it may take a bit of time before they share as you need them to.

**Practice being winsome and positive** – When you have operated in “curmudgeonness” for a while, your sensors need retraining. They need to be willfully redirected towards engaged relationship building and collaborative advancement. This is not the same as becoming “Susie Sunshine” but rather one who is welcome to participate in group meetings, developmental conversations, and enthusiastic business forecasting. The Oscar the Grouch vibe won’t get you there. Learning how to (re)function in a productive manner that is inclusive of all takes training. If you know someone who could help you reframe, ask them for help here as well.

Today is a great day to stop sitting in your office spouting negativity. It is a great day to change your frowning face and your down-on-the-world mentality. Today is a great day to get up and choose to engage openly and productively and be welcomed to do so. Being a curmudgeon doesn’t look good on anyone; stop trying to bring it into fashion.

Humareso Blog Posts-1-Born To Run

The only way forward is progress, a rousing sentiment. But I have seen the opposite be the way forward—regress. Falling behind, disastrous choices, infighting, broken processes…shall I continue? We likely all have experienced some of this. Do we forego the pithy sentiment about progression?

The objective motivator is the individual contribution by each, not by all. Sentiment becomes watered down when it’s generalized to all. We all know that “Hang in There” cat poster (thank you to that awesome show, The Middle, for memorializing it for posterity). When delivered to the whole, it is simply positive sentiment without real direction. However, when delivered to an individual, it becomes personal. What do I need to do in order to hang in there? The individual delivery is meant to be thought-provoking and encouraging.

When it comes to progress, the same objective can be offered specifically. The only way forward is progress as an individualized objective pushes the receiver to consider what that person can do as well as what is needed in order to do so. That’s progress. Walking into a department and saying, “Do Better” is generalized. A manager should not expect a team member to rise to the occasion after such a broad admonition. The path of least resistance is to say to one’s self, “I am doing the better. It’s everyone else.” And that is most often the end of the line of “motivation.”

Instead, if a department needs to do better, seek to address the individuals. The opening mandate to all may set the stage for what’s to come, but it’s the one-on-one dialogue that will bring to light those reflective considerations.

“Joe, the organization needs us to do better. What do you see as being an area of improvement we should address? How can you help to address that suggestion, and what will that take for you to do so?” This might be the purest way to start an individual check-in. And lest you think that each person will automatically say, “Oh, it’s me. I am the problem and will change my evil ways immediately,” (we’re so bitter, aren’t we?) it may take a moment or two for someone to get beyond the reason why it’s actually Marty’s fault that everything is crap. With some gentle, consistent questions, Joe will begin to think personally. “Well, Marty is part of the problem. I can see that we’ve become less motivated to do a great job. We have become okay with a passable job.” Those we-statements are code for I-statements, often done due to a lack of organizational trust or out of fear from previous interactions. Meet that person in those illuminating moments by affirming the perspective and asking to understand more deeply.

It is not easy for a first-time supervisor to draw out such reflection from a team. It takes practice. If you are a first-time manager, give yourself some grace.

And to those of you who get asked about progression and how you can participate, participate. Talk to your supervisor. Be gracious, thoughtful, and innovative. You do not need to be a doormat to do that. Focus on what you can do first. Or, I guess you could respond like Axl from **The Middle**, “…Together we are awesome. But alone, only I am still awesome.”

<!-- Source: What You Don't Know - Expectation Management and High Performance | 2025-01-28 17:45:00 | https://blog.humareso.com/what-you-dont-know-expectation-management-and-high-performance | what-you-dont-know-expectation-management-and-high-performance -->
Marriage is one of the best examples of expectation management. As someone who has traveled this road for almost 27 years, I have messed up and fallen short of that expectation management often (shocking, right?). I thought she would know something I needed or wanted automatically. Guess what? She did not. And I didn’t know hers either. That’s part of the fun of figuring this out. However, it doesn’t always feel like fun. It can be tense, hurtful, and annoying.

At work, it’s the same. We overlook how a lack of clear work expectations can lead to frustration, disengagement, and missed opportunities. It is part of our responsibility to ensure that our teams understand not only what’s expected of them but why it matters. Clarity is not a luxury; it’s a necessity!

We need to address ambiguity. Ambiguity leads to uncertainty, and uncertainty is a breeding ground for stress. Employees who aren’t sure what’s expected of them often end up second-guessing their work. We don’t need to facilitate lower confidence and poor productivity with our staff.

And we know how much unnecessary conflict arises when team members have differing interpretations of their roles. Managers struggle to communicate expectations and wind up defaulting to presumptions – “They should know how to do their job.” They may know how to do their job, but they may not know how the organization wants it done.

When expectations are vague, employees may also inadvertently focus their efforts on tasks that aren’t aligned with organizational goals. This misalignment doesn’t just impact individual performance - it affects the team and the company’s bottom line. Clear expectations eliminate this ambiguity. Sit and talk to your staff. Share what is needed for success.

And lest you think once is enough, outlining clear expectations doesn’t end with a one-time conversation. Feedback is the bridge between expectations and outcomes. Employees need to know how they’re doing and where they stand. Constructive feedback helps reinforce clarity by highlighting what’s working and addressing areas for improvement.

Feedback isn’t just a top-down exercise, either. Encourage employees to ask questions and provide input. Their perspectives can help identify areas where expectations might still be unclear. Collaborative conversations create a culture of mutual respect and shared responsibility for success. It’s a two-way street!

When employees have clarity, they gain confidence. Bottom line. They’re empowered to make decisions, take initiative, and innovate within their roles. This autonomy doesn’t just boost morale; it drives better results. Teams with clear expectations operate more efficiently, adapt more quickly to change, and deliver higher-quality work.

Just as I needed my wife to explain her needs and expectations, more than once, so do our staff and teams. Keep the cadence reasonable and your observations astute.
