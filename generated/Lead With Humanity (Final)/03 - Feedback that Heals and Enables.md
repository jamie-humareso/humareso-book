Hate. Just typing that word stops me in my tracks.

For the past few weeks, the number of online posts speaking to hate/haters seems to be spiking. Whether it be business owners who can’t keep up with the negative Yelp or Glassdoor reviews, or “Influencers” deluged with anti-fan commentary, or HR and TA practitioners finding themselves in the crosshairs of an online battle they didn’t sign up for, we are seeing many people stressed in response to hate.

And we know the difference between hate and calling someone or something out, right? If your organization supports discriminatory practices, then you can expect to hear about it through a variety of platforms. Discrimination, harassing environments or taking advantage of marginalized people will be called out, as it should be, and those in positions of power in those specific organizations can expect that to come. We live in a world where outrage over those truths will come to light quickly.

Individually, that type of correction does not need to be hateful, but it is certainly going to feel unwelcome. The discipline to change can be received as hate, but the fact is that when your organization is traveling down a wrong path, it will be called out. You should be prepared for that.

On the other hand, and more relevant to recent events, we have people feeling torn up by the unwelcome commentary about their work ethic, their work product and their assumed work performance. For some people, posting online about their work is part of their brand and their marketing strategy. The negative can come in response to one of those posts. Some will respond right under the post mocking your perspective and assuming your frame of reference. Some may quote your post on their page to blast you and tell their audience how dumb you are. Some negativity has also come behind the scenes – reaching out to an event planner to dissuade them from working with you, for instance.

And some of you might say, “Well, if they are going to post, then they have to be ready for all the responses – good and bad.” You would be right. You do have to be ready. Where I think we may be off course a bit, though, is when we go for the jugular of that person. If you don’t like the way someone markets their recruiting efforts, then you can banter about philosophies and approaches, but to go after their role as an employee for a company, or as a mother, or as a human is too far.

So, what do we do? First, if you are going to share your work online, get ready for the pushback. In the United States, in particular, most people operate as armchair quarterbacks. The “expertise” that people believe they have is astounding. To that end, the brazenness to be that “expert” on social media can often be cruel; the studies on “toxic disinhibition” are insightful. We just need to be ready for those types to jump in and be unkind.

Secondly, those who post and share their work need to toughen up a bit. If you are going to walk into a Cyber Colosseum, so to speak, then you need your armor on. It is a battle, and hate is the oft-used weapon of your opponent. The battle preparation for you will consist of grounding – what do you believe in and how does that help to identify you? Lean into the truths of who you know you are, despite the random name-calling coming at you. The more you are grounded, the less impactful the hate will be.

This blog is a tough one to write. I tend to operate with a glass-half-full mentality. I don’t want to give hate more press than it already has. But there are real people who are falling apart. I am seeing and hearing accounts of these attacks online, including DMs to their bosses, colleagues, and yes, even to their adult children.

Let’s take a few moments to check in on our colleagues. This work is hard. Those standing up for others and for ideals need support. Those working hard to build a brand need support. Those trying to improve themselves need support. We can be more committed to that and learn better how to let the effects of hate roll off our backs.

!Humareso Blog Posts-1-Mr. CellophaneMy kids are talented. Obviously.

All throughout their childhoods, there were marked opportunities for greatness and future renown. Now, I know that every parent thinks this, but they’re wrong. My kids were the best (says every parent). My son was destined for MLB, my eldest daughter was going to be the next Matisse, and my youngest daughter was Broadway-bound. Look, I had great expectations.

When Cass, my youngest, was cast as one of the Cell Block girls in the musical Chicago (yes, a high school production), I knew that my dreams were underway. And when she belted those numbers while doing the inverted spread eagle on a chair, I thought, here we go! Alas, she had other plans for her future (Selfish!).

But there was this young man in the role of Amos Hart singing “Mr. Cellophane” who poured himself into that singular star-power moment from the show. His unassuming demeanor resonated with the lyrics he sang. I believed that everyone could look right through him and walk right by him, as the song goes. He owned the role.

Too often, we have people in our organizations who have similar roles. They are easily overlooked without a word spoken in protest. We count on their quiet fortitude and non-complaining demeanor. We say they are just grateful for the work and don’t want to rock the boat. And while that may be true for some, we honestly have no idea…that is, until they resign.

The shock and the betrayal we feel. How could they do this to us? Why would they do this to us? They were such good workers, and we told them every so often, maybe. That seemed to be enough, right? I mean, our attention is normally given to the loud mouths and troublemakers, so we don’t really have time to coddle everyone, especially the quiet ones. The ones that you chose not to engage or recognize.

Don’t let Mr. Cellophane fool you. He’s a hard worker. He shows up on time and is consistent in his work. He is dependable as the day is long. He is Joe, Melanie, Diego and Shawna. He is every employee whose name you are struggling to recall. You know that person who’s been here for five years? Yes, that one.

We need those people. That is not to say, however, that the right response to those coming to mind is to promote them to management. Stop with the singular career ladder. Not every person, in some ways especially a Mr. Cellophane, wants to manage others. There are alternative career ladders that can be activated. We forget this sometimes.

Deepen your interest in those who have made an investment of consistency and “meets expectations” through the years. They have a place within our organizations, and we ought to recognize them. Check in with those who don’t lobby for your time. Encourage coaching conversations focused on process improvement and innovation. Ask specific questions; open-ended questions might foster quick one-word answers from Mr. Cellophane. Seek to know and to understand.

Perhaps the worst thing that an employee could share about their experience is from the song itself:

> "A human being's made of more than air
>
> With all that bulk, you're bound to see him there
>
> Unless that human being next to you
>
> Is unimpressive, undistinguished, you know who."

Let’s not wait for the resignation for us to pay attention to the reliable workers in our companies. Don’t walk by another employee that you haven’t checked in with in months, years, ever.

<!-- Source: Born to Run - The Individual Call to Progress | 2025-06-17 18:00:14 | https://blog.humareso.com/born-to-run-the-individual-call-to-progress | born-to-run-the-individual-call-to-progress -->
!Humareso Blog Posts-1-Born To Run

The only way forward is progress, a rousing sentiment. But I have seen the opposite be the way forward—regress. Falling behind, disastrous choices, infighting, broken processes…shall I continue? We likely all have experienced some of this. Do we forego the pithy sentiment about progression?

The objective motivator is the individual contribution by each, not by all. Sentiment becomes watered down when it’s generalized to all. We all know that “Hang in There” cat poster (thank you to that awesome show, The Middle, for memorializing it for posterity). When delivered to the whole, it is simply positive sentiment without real direction. However, when delivered to an individual, it becomes personal. What do I need to do in order to hang in there? The individual delivery is meant to be thought-provoking and encouraging.

When it comes to progress, the same objective can be offered specifically. The only way forward is progress as an individualized objective pushes the receiver to consider what that person can do as well as what is needed in order to do so. That’s progress. Walking into a department and saying, “Do Better” is generalized. A manager should not expect a team member to rise to the occasion after such a broad admonition. The path of least resistance is to say to one’s self, “I am doing the better. It’s everyone else.” And that is most often the end of the line of “motivation.”

Instead, if a department needs to do better, seek to address the individuals. The opening mandate to all may set the stage for what’s to come, but it’s the one-on-one dialogue that will bring to light those reflective considerations.

“Joe, the organization needs us to do better. What do you see as being an area of improvement we should address? How can you help to address that suggestion, and what will that take for you to do so?” This might be the purest way to start an individual check-in. And lest you think that each person will automatically say, “Oh, it’s me. I am the problem and will change my evil ways immediately,” (we’re so bitter, aren’t we?) it may take a moment or two for someone to get beyond the reason why it’s actually Marty’s fault that everything is crap. With some gentle, consistent questions, Joe will begin to think personally. “Well, Marty is part of the problem. I can see that we’ve become less motivated to do a great job. We have become okay with a passable job.” Those we-statements are code for I-statements, often done due to a lack of organizational trust or out of fear from previous interactions. Meet that person in those illuminating moments by affirming the perspective and asking to understand more deeply.

It is not easy for a first-time supervisor to draw out such reflection from a team. It takes practice. If you are a first-time manager, give yourself some grace.

And to those of you who get asked about progression and how you can participate, participate. Talk to your supervisor. Be gracious, thoughtful, and innovative. You do not need to be a doormat to do that. Focus on what you can do first. Or, I guess you could respond like Axl from **The Middle**, “…Together we are awesome. But alone, only I am still awesome.”

Before we move on, let’s connect Born to Run - The Individual Call to Progress to What You Don't Know - Expectation Management and High Performance. We shift from Employee Relations to Feedback to advance our feedback that heals and enables.

<!-- Source: What You Don't Know - Expectation Management and High Performance | 2025-01-28 17:45:00 | https://blog.humareso.com/what-you-dont-know-expectation-management-and-high-performance | what-you-dont-know-expectation-management-and-high-performance -->
Marriage is one of the best examples of expectation management. As someone who has traveled this road for almost 27 years, I have messed up and fallen short of that expectation management often (shocking, right?). I thought she would know something I needed or wanted automatically. Guess what? She did not. And I didn’t know hers either. That’s part of the fun of figuring this out. However, it doesn’t always feel like fun. It can be tense, hurtful, and annoying.

At work, it’s the same. We overlook how a lack of clear work expectations can lead to frustration, disengagement, and missed opportunities. It is part of our responsibility to ensure that our teams understand not only what’s expected of them but why it matters. Clarity is not a luxury; it’s a necessity!

We need to address ambiguity. Ambiguity leads to uncertainty, and uncertainty is a breeding ground for stress. Employees who aren’t sure what’s expected of them often end up second-guessing their work. We don’t need to facilitate lower confidence and poor productivity with our staff.

And we know how much unnecessary conflict arises when team members have differing interpretations of their roles. Managers struggle to communicate expectations and wind up defaulting to presumptions – “They should know how to do their job.” They may know how to do their job, but they may not know how the organization wants it done.

When expectations are vague, employees may also inadvertently focus their efforts on tasks that aren’t aligned with organizational goals. This misalignment doesn’t just impact individual performance - it affects the team and the company’s bottom line. Clear expectations eliminate this ambiguity. Sit and talk to your staff. Share what is needed for success.

And lest you think once is enough, outlining clear expectations doesn’t end with a one-time conversation. Feedback is the bridge between expectations and outcomes. Employees need to know how they’re doing and where they stand. Constructive feedback helps reinforce clarity by highlighting what’s working and addressing areas for improvement.

Feedback isn’t just a top-down exercise, either. Encourage employees to ask questions and provide input. Their perspectives can help identify areas where expectations might still be unclear. Collaborative conversations create a culture of mutual respect and shared responsibility for success. It’s a two-way street!

When employees have clarity, they gain confidence. Bottom line. They’re empowered to make decisions, take initiative, and innovate within their roles. This autonomy doesn’t just boost morale; it drives better results. Teams with clear expectations operate more efficiently, adapt more quickly to change, and deliver higher-quality work.

Just as I needed my wife to explain her needs and expectations, more than once, so do our staff and teams. Keep the cadence reasonable and your observations astute.

There has always been an appeal to the Academy Awards for me. To this day, I still envision myself holding that Oscar for Best Actor or Best Supporting Actor (I am not picky), giving thanks to those who have helped me realize this goal. It’s not because I want to be a mega-huge superstar but because I enjoy acting, and I know I have the talent for it. I can’t sing, so there won’t be musicals in my future, but a good dramatic role that I could sink my teeth into is right up my alley. Who knows? Now that I have put this out into the world, someone might offer me a spot in their next major motion picture! (I won’t be waiting by the phone)

The truth is, many of us have unrealized dreams. Your dreams and hopes are special, even if they do not come to fruition. If the Oscar isn’t handed to me, my life is not a failure. I am grounded enough to know that there are more components to my life than one fantasy. While it would be fun, it won’t make me any more “something.” I am something now.

You are dealing with your own dreams. Are you “less than” because it hasn’t happened or happened yet? How are you defining yourself, and how are you defining success? The rub here is that our stability is oft influenced by visual reminders of what we don’t have. Spend any time on social media, and you will be convinced that your life is not where it ought to be. You aren’t as fabulous as the chiseled, fit bodies flexing on Instagram Stories. You aren’t as brilliant as those teaching LinkedIn Live webinars. You aren’t as “something” as what you see. The visual reminders can be debilitating.

Firstly, do you have the dreams you have because of the pressure from outside cues or is it because of your own internal motivations and desires? Authentic aspirations are exciting, motivating and captivating. That does not mean they are easy to achieve, but the motivations are genuine. Instead, if the aspirations are because of what you see, you may live too much in comparison. Unhealth can set in. Those pressured aspirations can set you up to fail.

Secondly, motivation towards your dreams isn’t about being preached to, but rather to be encouraged towards. There are those making a living by berating you into go-go-go mentality of achievement. Listen, I am all for some directed push. I can be lazy. I can grow tired, so I do need a few to remind me of the dreams I am working towards. Those relationships are dear to me. That’s a far cry from the half dozen podcasts you might be listening to where your existence is questioned at every turn. Those people should not serve to minimize or belittle you. If they rightly motivate, then stick with them. If you feel like a piece of crap after you listen, stop listening.

A final thought is that delayed is not denied. Today might be the day your dreams are actualized, but it might happen farther the road. Keep walking towards it. Again, it’s not a total failure if it never materializes, but you don’t know what might happen in the future. Resigning yourself to maintaining a “less than” frame of mind can lead to poor self-esteem and worth, even to mental health strains. You are still traveling along the road. You are not there yet. Keep walking.

In the past month, I have heard from at least a handful of people who are saddened by what’s not yet true of them. They are struggling to see the value in what they’re learning along the way. If this is you, use the sadness. It might jolt you into more focused activity towards those aspirations. The sadness might give you reason to review and to redefine, if necessary, those dreams you have. The sadness is a tool, not a state of being, in this perspective.

When I win that Academy Award, I will be thanking those who helped me to run after what I said I wanted to run after. I will feel satisfied with the accomplishment, and I should. However, the realized dream doesn’t mean I am done. There are other dreams to birth to fruition. I am an active being; so are you. And so are those you work with. We’re all running after it. It’s better to be a partner to as many as possible. Realizing this should influence your compassionate view of family, co-workers, even your boss! We all have dreams. What’s your dream?

Before we move on, let’s connect Dreams to You're So Vain: The Egotism in Performance Appraisals. We shift from Life Paths to Performance to advance our feedback that heals and enables.

For fans of 30 Rock, Jenna Maroney was the epitome of self-centeredness. She found herself often at an emotional crossroads when her performance on “TGS” was deemed less than stellar by her colleagues, writers or directors. Brilliantly played by Jane Krokowski, Jenna was the pinnacle of conceit, self-absorption and frailty. In many ways, Jenna is all of us when it comes to critique.  
  
Is my ego so fragile that when I “meet expectations” on a performance appraisal, I sit in full disbelief and disgust in the obvious underappreciation by my employer? For the modern American worker, in particular, you bet your bippy that’s how it is. And it’s been this way for some time.  
  
As a country, the United States has struggled with its own narcissistic tendencies for decades; Americans think better of themselves, today, by default. Daniel Altman (2011) wrote:  
  
Psychologists have been tracking narcissism through surveys of American college students since the late 1970s, and levels of it—often measured as a lack of empathy—have never been higher, according to Sara Konrath, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan’s Research Center for Group Dynamics. “If you look at the levers in society, almost all of them are pushing us towards narcissism,” she says. These levers go beyond Twitter feeds and Facebook pages, which offer endless opportunities for self-admiration. They also include advertising that tells consumers “You’re worth it” and reality-TV shows that turn regular people against each other in a battle for celebrity. (Altman)  
  
It’s no wonder that, in the American workforce, being average is insulting. Even if the manager delivering the news is not presenting it in a negative tone, the rating of “Meets Expectations” is enough to trigger a poor response. At the onset, a wise manager needs to know what he/she/they are dealing with amongst the team. Whether it’s from historical data or behavioral assessment, a manager should have measured responses to know what’s coming.  
  
And secondly, managers need to be ready to define and to justify an effective performance management system. These systems are all about building superior performance. The necessary piece is to understand, first for yourself as manager, what an effective performance management system is. For far too many, performance management is equal to performance appraisal. The annual or semi-annual performance assessment form is the bane of most managers’ existence. The completion of the form becomes the ultimate goal with very little measured thought or metrics-based assessment making its way onto the appraisal. Who has time for such things? Am I right?  
  
Well, that’s why we wind up with narcissistic, overly self-impressed employees. We have not taught them any better. Effective performance management is about the long view with consistent feedback to affirm, rebuke and course correct. Without direction, anyone’s eyes would look to self, first, and then to a comparison to those around. If I  
  
perceive that I am better than most of my colleagues (which most do), then I will only be satisfied with an “Exceeds Expectations” on an appraisal. An employee needs direction in what is being measured, why it’s being measured, how it’s being measured and for what overall purpose does that vein of work provide. Effectiveness cannot be just for the task, but for the overall goals of the team, division and organization. Effective is moving things forward.  
  
I’ve known people who were great at tying a cherry stem into a knot with only their tongues. I have had successful tries, but not all of them were winners. A couple of friends of mine were incredibly talented at performing this feat. I could count on them every time. Think about the tasks that some of your employees can do successfully almost every time. Does that success mean effectiveness? I am not sure what overall goal tying cherry stems with your tongues would push a team towards (keep those thoughts in your head!), but if I just affirm that feat, I am causing performers to think more of that achievement than they ought.  
  
However, if there are tasks that do build towards the whole, then have a right metric in place to affirm those contributions. Herein is where the “we’ve always done it this way” attitude can take hold. If someone is performing the same way but is never held accountable to a new system for success measurement, then you should not be upset with that employee. It’s management’s fault. Explain why the completion of that tasks isn’t enough anymore. Teach, train, coach and mentor. Effectiveness is not ready in 24 hours. It’s more a slow cooker when changing previous constructs. Keep the low heat going and stir regularly.

!Humareso Blog Posts-15-LoveI had the chance to watch a rerun of The Love Boat recently. Yes, Pluto TV and I are good friends. I get to watch lots of old programming (The Price is Right – The Barker Years is a particular treat), and I often have an episode with the Pacific Princess playing on a Sunday afternoon while I prep for the week ahead. The guest stars are absolutely amazing. Don’t scoff. Take a peek at the long list of A-listers that rubbed elbows with the D-Listers. On this particular episode, Eddie Mekka played a high school friend of “Julie, Your Cruise Director” (it’s a requirement to say it together) who, within 30 seconds of being on the ship, sees the love of his life. He didn’t speak to her. He hadn’t heard her voice. He just saw her from afar and decided that she was “the one.” And, of course, in true Love Boat fashion, that three-day cruise, after some fumbling and lying, proved his wish to be granted. He and Audrey Landers left the boat with plans to marry. See? Easy.  
  
It got me thinking about how we approach career opportunities in a similar fashion. We look to fall in love and to do so quickly.  
  
Be honest. Haven’t you walked into an interview or logged onto your video appointment hoping to get “that feeling?” It’s not to say that you don’t care about the work, the community or the structure of the organization. It’s just that you might want to get the butterflies in your belly first.  
  
Walking in holistically prepared for that interview (throughout the whole process, actually) is likely the best way to avoid a sensory-biased decision-making process. Have a plan of engagement which includes your perspectives and questions based upon some legwork you’ve done regarding the company’s work, history, reviews, cultural insights, etc. Remember, this is an interview for the organization as much as it is for you.  
  
I am in the throws of some hiring now. Truthfully, I am keeping track of the approach. Less than 8% of those I am interviewing ask any questions…at all. I specifically leave time towards the end of the interview to invite the asking of anything about the organization. More than 90% of the time, the interviewee says something like, “Thank you, but I don’t have any questions. I just want to say how excited I am about this opportunity.”  
  
Look, I love that people want to work with the awesome team that’s been assembled (Avengers!), but there should be things about the company that you would want to know. Ask about the organization’s commitment to excellence in its work. Ask about how an equitable environment has been created and fostered (and if it’s not yet there, ask about what the hold up is). Ask about why this role is open. If it’s an additional role, ask how it was determined that this was the right time to add. If it’s a replacement role, ask why the previous employee moved out of the job. Ask about the manner with which investment in the persons of the company are made, not just in benefits (certainly including this, though), but also in areas of competency development, work-life integration, community involvement and the like.  
  
This prep work will balance out the emotional desire to “just know” that this is the right place for your next role. There is nothing wrong with enjoying a stroll around the deck in the moonlight while wearing a chiffon gown. However, the engine room, the laundry room and the staff quarters are just as important to get a true view if you’re planning on investing yourself on that ship.
