<!-- Source: Shake It Off: When the Haters' Hate Really Hurts | 2025-07-30 17:28:56 | https://blog.humareso.com/shake-it-off-when-the-haters-hate-really-hurts | shake-it-off-when-the-haters-hate-really-hurts -->
!Blog Post_Shake It Off (1).png)

Hate. Just typing that word stops me in my tracks.

For the past few weeks, the number of online posts speaking to hate/haters seems to be spiking. Whether it be business owners who can’t keep up with the negative Yelp or Glassdoor reviews, or “Influencers” deluged with anti-fan commentary, or HR and TA practitioners finding themselves in the crosshairs of an online battle they didn’t sign up for, we are seeing many people stressed in response to hate.

And we know the difference between hate and calling someone or something out, right? If your organization supports discriminatory practices, then you can expect to hear about it through a variety of platforms. Discrimination, harassing environments or taking advantage of marginalized people will be called out, as it should be, and those in positions of power in those specific organizations can expect that to come. We live in a world where outrage over those truths will come to light quickly.

Individually, that type of correction does not need to be hateful, but it is certainly going to feel unwelcome. The discipline to change can be received as hate, but the fact is that when your organization is traveling down a wrong path, it will be called out. You should be prepared for that.

On the other hand, and more relevant to recent events, we have people feeling torn up by the unwelcome commentary about their work ethic, their work product and their assumed work performance. For some people, posting online about their work is part of their brand and their marketing strategy. The negative can come in response to one of those posts. Some will respond right under the post mocking your perspective and assuming your frame of reference. Some may quote your post on their page to blast you and tell their audience how dumb you are. Some negativity has also come behind the scenes – reaching out to an event planner to dissuade them from working with you, for instance.

And some of you might say, “Well, if they are going to post, then they have to be ready for all the responses – good and bad.” You would be right. You do have to be ready. Where I think we may be off course a bit, though, is when we go for the jugular of that person. If you don’t like the way someone markets their recruiting efforts, then you can banter about philosophies and approaches, but to go after their role as an employee for a company, or as a mother, or as a human is too far.

So, what do we do? First, if you are going to share your work online, get ready for the pushback. In the United States, in particular, most people operate as armchair quarterbacks. The “expertise” that people believe they have is astounding. To that end, the brazenness to be that “expert” on social media can often be cruel; the studies on “toxic disinhibition” are insightful. We just need to be ready for those types to jump in and be unkind.

Secondly, those who post and share their work need to toughen up a bit. If you are going to walk into a Cyber Colosseum, so to speak, then you need your armor on. It is a battle, and hate is the oft-used weapon of your opponent. The battle preparation for you will consist of grounding – what do you believe in and how does that help to identify you? Lean into the truths of who you know you are, despite the random name-calling coming at you. The more you are grounded, the less impactful the hate will be.

This blog is a tough one to write. I tend to operate with a glass-half-full mentality. I don’t want to give hate more press than it already has. But there are real people who are falling apart. I am seeing and hearing accounts of these attacks online, including DMs to their bosses, colleagues, and yes, even to their adult children.

Let’s take a few moments to check in on our colleagues. This work is hard. Those standing up for others and for ideals need support. Those working hard to build a brand need support. Those trying to improve themselves need support. We can be more committed to that and learn better how to let the effects of hate roll off our backs.

!Humareso Blog Posts-1-Made You Look (1).jpeg)

Talent attraction is ambiguous. There are a series of questions that might help us to define a path towards it. What will it take to get a candidate to be drawn to what our organization has to offer? Is it compensation? Benefits? Mobility or flexibility? Advancement? Is it all this and more? So, how do you know what to focus on?

When Ross decided it was time for him to change his approach to dating (to be more attractive, to break out of his routine/brand), he purchased a pair of leather pants for a date. It is one of the more hilarious episodes of Friends as Ross experiences the discomfort in fit, temperature and flexibility in those pants while on that date. What started out as a stance on being different, relevant, attractive and engaging turned into awkwardness, discomfort, unattractiveness and failing to get him a second date.

Is your company trying to put on “leather pants” to attract talent? Sigh.

Ask your teams about the brand. Start with what you have access to – those who have aligned themselves to the organization. At a basic level, there is some attraction for that employee to be part of the company. Whether “it’s just a paycheck” or up to “I love it here,” there is feedback to start with in nailing down a talent attraction approach. Ask them what it would take to have someone take a second look at our company. Ask them why they did. Use that information to provide foundational components to the attraction strategy.

Leaving it to the executive team alone to determine why someone would want to be part of the organization is a flat, biased plan forward. If they are alone to reinvent the talent attraction and brand alignment approach, they often believe they have their fingers on the pulse. A recent PwC survey of executives revealed that 76% of them “agree that they have the capabilities to execute business model changes at scale.” Now, think about that from an employee’s perspective. When they see physical plant issues (a toilet that’s been leaking for weeks, for instance) or organizational structure needs (job leveling, leadership approaches, compensation analytics, etc.) that have not been addressed, it causes doubt regarding the “capabilities” available to execute. Executives might think more highly of themselves than they ought.

The language around culture is also a limited approach. It is highly unlikely that a company would advertise: *“Come join us. We have a mediocre culture and we’re barely getting by”* (I don’t suggest this approach). Instead, we see an uninspiring tale of vibrant culture and inclusive opportunities. These messages become noise and lost in the sea of others saying the same. And further, incumbent employees see this and, if it isn’t quite true, double down on the liars that run the organization. That’s not the messaging that you want.

Talent attraction is a mix of cultural truths and brand management, yes, but it is also organizational opportunities, market penetration tactics, competency development and total rewards offerings. It is all of it which provides many messaging opportunities for talent acquisition, human resources and marketing teams to collaborate and to deliver.

Think about the messaging. What does it tell others about the organization? Hear it from the vantage point of someone who does not know anything or much about the company. Use friends and family at times to provide feedback on their impressions based on the messaging. And don’t be defensive about it! You want to hear those responses.

Lastly, stay authentic to what the company really is. Overpromising is a death sentence. Employees will share with a new employee, usually within the first week, as to what the truths are. The leather pants are not a lasting strategy. Take them off (er, wait a minute, that’s not what I meant).

!Humareso Blog Posts-1-Mr. CellophaneMy kids are talented. Obviously.

All throughout their childhoods, there were marked opportunities for greatness and future renown. Now, I know that every parent thinks this, but they’re wrong. My kids were the best (says every parent). My son was destined for MLB, my eldest daughter was going to be the next Matisse, and my youngest daughter was Broadway-bound. Look, I had great expectations.

When Cass, my youngest, was cast as one of the Cell Block girls in the musical Chicago (yes, a high school production), I knew that my dreams were underway. And when she belted those numbers while doing the inverted spread eagle on a chair, I thought, here we go! Alas, she had other plans for her future (Selfish!).

But there was this young man in the role of Amos Hart singing “Mr. Cellophane” who poured himself into that singular star-power moment from the show. His unassuming demeanor resonated with the lyrics he sang. I believed that everyone could look right through him and walk right by him, as the song goes. He owned the role.

Too often, we have people in our organizations who have similar roles. They are easily overlooked without a word spoken in protest. We count on their quiet fortitude and non-complaining demeanor. We say they are just grateful for the work and don’t want to rock the boat. And while that may be true for some, we honestly have no idea…that is, until they resign.

The shock and the betrayal we feel. How could they do this to us? Why would they do this to us? They were such good workers, and we told them every so often, maybe. That seemed to be enough, right? I mean, our attention is normally given to the loud mouths and troublemakers, so we don’t really have time to coddle everyone, especially the quiet ones. The ones that you chose not to engage or recognize.

Don’t let Mr. Cellophane fool you. He’s a hard worker. He shows up on time and is consistent in his work. He is dependable as the day is long. He is Joe, Melanie, Diego and Shawna. He is every employee whose name you are struggling to recall. You know that person who’s been here for five years? Yes, that one.

We need those people. That is not to say, however, that the right response to those coming to mind is to promote them to management. Stop with the singular career ladder. Not every person, in some ways especially a Mr. Cellophane, wants to manage others. There are alternative career ladders that can be activated. We forget this sometimes.

Deepen your interest in those who have made an investment of consistency and “meets expectations” through the years. They have a place within our organizations, and we ought to recognize them. Check in with those who don’t lobby for your time. Encourage coaching conversations focused on process improvement and innovation. Ask specific questions; open-ended questions might foster quick one-word answers from Mr. Cellophane. Seek to know and to understand.

Perhaps the worst thing that an employee could share about their experience is from the song itself:

> "A human being's made of more than air
>
> With all that bulk, you're bound to see him there
>
> Unless that human being next to you
>
> Is unimpressive, undistinguished, you know who."

Let’s not wait for the resignation for us to pay attention to the reliable workers in our companies. Don’t walk by another employee that you haven’t checked in with in months, years, ever.

This week, I had the privilege of attending **Workhuman Live 2025**, and I’m walking away with a head full of insights and a heart full of inspiration. The event was a powerful reminder that, in the age of AI, agility, and accelerating change, what truly sets organizations apart is still deeply human: connection, courage, and culture.

1. Human Data > Skills Hype

**Jess VonBank** from Mercer posed a provocative question: *“Are we over-rotating on skills architecture?”* It’s true—while organizations scramble to build skills-based systems, the reality is that skills are fluid, context-dependent, and notoriously hard to quantify. Fewer than 25% of HR leaders trust self-reported skills data, and AI-driven skills inference still misses the nuance of behavior.

Here’s the interesting twist: **recognition data**—those everyday moments when peers call out strengths—might just hold the key to understanding how skills actually show up in the real world. It’s not just about what people know; it’s about how they apply it, how others experience it, and how they grow over time.

**2. Resilience Is a Muscle You Build—One Rejection at a Time**

One of the most memorable sessions came from author and keynote speaker **Alex Banayan**, who broke down what he calls the *“Rejection Inspection.”* Rejection, he reminded us, is inevitable—but it doesn’t have to be defining.

His three-part framework offers a human-centered way to reframe failure:

* **Reset the system** (go for a walk, take a nap, grab ice cream)
* **Realign the navigation** (remind yourself *why* you do this work)
* **Reexamine the engine** (question the story you're telling yourself)

The stories we tell ourselves—about our worth, our future, and our potential—shape everything. And in a field like HR, where we’re often the emotional engine of the organization, learning to process rejection with grace and grit is mission-critical.

**3. Curiosity Creates New Worlds**

**!Image (7).jpeg)Trevor Noah** brought wisdom and wit to the stage, offering a powerful reflection on the role of curiosity in uncertain times. “Prepare for what you would like to do—even if that job doesn’t exist yet,” he said. In a world where AI is reshaping industries, and job descriptions are constantly evolving, this mindset is gold.

AI won’t solve everything, but it *will* create new possibilities. The key is to stay curious, keep asking better questions, and be ready to grow into spaces that don’t even exist yet.

One of the most recurring messages throughout the conference: **show people what’s possible**, not just what to do. Whether it's about building inclusive cultures, adopting new technologies, or bouncing back from setbacks, leaders who lead with transparency and vulnerability are the ones who drive real change.

Implicit messaging—what we *do*, not just what we *say*—has far more power than we often realize. If we want employees to be agile, open-minded, and resilient, we have to model that ourselves.

The future of work isn’t just about strategy or structure. It’s about storytelling, belonging, recognition, and resilience. So, as I head back to the day-to-day, I’m carrying with me a renewed sense of purpose—and a sticky note on my desk that says: *“Show people what’s possible.”*

<!-- Source: Wicked Game: Toxicity Shouldn't Be the Way to Build Fortitude | 2025-02-18 20:15:21 | https://blog.humareso.com/wicked-game-toxicity-shouldnt-be-the-way-to-build-fortitude | wicked-game-toxicity-shouldnt-be-the-way-to-build-fortitude -->
!Humareso Blog Posts-1-Wicked Game

Have you seen that hilarious commercial for the Aunts? Geico has put out some incredible commercials through the years, and this one is no exception. The concept of uninvited houseguests who also happen to be aunts of the homeowners is an approachable setup for the viewer. You may likely have an aunt like that. She comes into the home and comments on everything; it’s like a wicked game for these aunts. Our feelings of inadequacy rise to the surface. Ah, good times. To tap into such emotions, albeit tension and toxicity, brings a shared experience to life. That is the mark of a great commercial. Even though it’s been four years since its initial release, the commercial is still being played currently.

The shared experience of that commercial is fine when it’s at a distance. If we were really living that experience, however, the response would be much different. The annoyance of people pointing out your flaws and missteps would drive you out the door or to commit a felony. In the day-to-day, people in organizations tend to experience this type of interaction in a slow and steady manner. Chipping away at our self-esteem, we may sit despondent hoping that another interaction with colleagues wouldn’t be for another six months.

This cannot be the truth that we allow people to live in.

Fortitude is a great durable skill. Through encounters like these, our employees can learn how to become grounded, to filter out unnecessary distractions and to perform at the level the organization needs. But this is not an excuse for a poor work environment. The competency building needs not to be done on the backs of trauma and toxicity. In other words, the ends do not justify the means.

How else can we build fortitude in our staff? Firstly, expect the challenges and failures to come. Sounds simple, right? However, we don’t usually include in our onboarding protocols expectation management around failure. Work failure is a very real part of the experience at your organization, especially if it is promoting creativity, innovation and change.

By setting the tone for challenges to come, we promote coping mechanism development. How can an employee best train themselves in managing stress and in maintaining a forward-thinking perspective? We can provide resources in mindfulness, in relaxation, in mental acuity and toughness. All these areas can lead to a healthy development of fortitude in our staff.

It’s much easier to build support structures and cultivate adaptability when someone has invested internally in the hard work of fortitude development. Too often, organizations throw mentoring and resource groups at staff without providing a way for the individual to first invest in self. Those structures are difficult to maintain when the foundation is not there, or maybe even worse, if the “aunts” have been allowed to build their foundations.

Today is a great day to remove those Auntie Influencers; they are the ones who are now “expired!”

!Humareso Blog Posts-9-Waiting for a girl like you (1).jpeg)In the movie **Life Itself**, Oscar Issac’s character, Will, has a great line about waiting for the right moment to ask out Abby (Olivia Wilde). He is waiting for the right moment because when he starts this relationship with her, he is all in. There won’t be any turning back. He wants to ask her out at the right moment to set that tone from the onset. He’s waiting with a purpose.

And we might be working with some of those “waiters” as well. Over 90% of Gen Z and Millennial employees would like to change jobs this year. The percentage, however, falls dramatically when pushed as to whether they really will.

The economic environment is affecting the confidence that our employees have about moving on. Most feel that it’s necessary to move on as it will likely open doors for higher pay and greater responsibility. There are varying studies showing different results regarding compensation differentiation based on staying or leaving. For instance, a recent analysis done by Sentinel Pay Analytics for an organization with about 23,000 employees showed no difference in pay levels between those who’ve stayed and those who boomeranged back to the company. That’s not the case in all organizations, but banking on it in the current economic state appears too risky.

“The number one thing people are craving right now is stability—especially in their workplaces,” said Ella F. Washington, PhD, an organizational psychologist and professor of practice at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business. This jives with what many of you are facing. And while employees may have interest in leaving as soon as they feel confident to do so, we don’t have to accept that fate. Organizations can take steps to change that trajectory.

Own dialogue – Look to engage with people…on purpose. For managers and human resources practitioners, the no news is good news philosophy has affected our intentionality with our staff. We stay distant and we chat only about work process or product. These heavily transactional conversations cause a utilitarian vibe to be felt by our employees. Engage with work-related conversations, of course, but also recognize that performance-based dialogue includes skill development in relationally areas, too. Work with your team by talking to your team.

Encourage innovation – Too often we’re too busy. We cannot take the time to foster creativity because we have deadlines or quotas to meet. We keep our eyes on only the finish line, and we fail to meet people in innovative advancements. Your teams have ideas. They want processes to be better. They see the value in what they are doing, but they also want to influence what they are doing. They want to make a change for the good of the whole, truly. We may be tempted to minimize creativity because of that one time it didn’t work out. Innovation leaves room for failure so don’t be surprised that you will have to try again. It is not a reason to stop pushing forward.

Offer transparency in moderation – Organizations that function fully in transparency – sharing every data point possible – may unintentionally foster fear. When sales fall slightly, or when expenses increase over one month, we might have to handle worries from the team. This is not to say that transparency is bad; actually, quite the opposite. Employees feel more tied to the organization when they have a level of understanding as well as the opportunity to ask deeper questions. Allow for that while keeping considerate of how much data is going out.

It's not too late to keep some people who may be thinking about a move, delayed as it may be. The current economy might give organizations a false sense of security. You may not be doing as well as you think just because turnover is down. The economic stagnation, presidential election, high inflation, and other considerations could be affecting the status quo nature of employee retention.

And to be clear, there are still employees leaving their roles now. We can’t look at data so hard and fast in all categories. The trend is not universal, nor should it be. Either way, taking a look at how you might influence a change in direction is worth your time.

<!-- Source: Promises, Promises: The Wooing of Candidates | 2023-10-05 15:48:25 | https://blog.humareso.com/wooing-candidates | wooing-candidates -->
!Humareso Blog Posts-6-PromisesThe wooing of talent takes skill, determination, availability…and a bit of luck. We don’t like that luck part. It’s out of our control. I can make myself available. I can improve my skills in rapport development, full spectrum sourcing, and job marketing. I can put the dedicated time in. But catching someone at the right place, right time and in the right mood? That isn’t in our control.

The default for some recruiting pros and hiring managers is to overpromise in order to manufacture luck. Creative career mapping opportunities are well-delivered but based upon no actual history of offering such options to existing staff. A commitment to knowledge deepening is espoused, but often there is no time or budget committed to this endeavor. Warm affirmations regarding the company values are wrapped like a blanket around the candidate, but the existing staff have yet to find that blanket.

The lies that are told (yes, I am calling them lies) lay a foundation that requires an all-or-nothing response from the candidate. You’ve given them everything you can – money, culture, opportunity promises – and that sets up extremes. If the candidate accepts these conditions and joins the team, only to then find out rather quickly that no such opportunities are ready to be presented (nor may they ever be), then the quick departure occurs. Hiring managers return to scrambling to fill the once-again open role (usually citing the previous person to be a “just didn’t fit” employee) where they will return to promising experiences unlikely to happen.

On the other hand, if the candidate calls the bluff and asks to speak to a current employee or two who are doing the same or similar work (yes, that happens at times), recruiters know they’ve been had. How could they let the candidate ask about these, at best, exaggerated opportunities to the current team? Won’t the staff finish that conversation with the candidate and march directly to the manager to ask when their developmental options will begin? The all-or-nothing is setup and it’s impossible to unwind.

Recruiters and hiring managers need to stand firm in following some basic principles of talent wooing:

First, speak the truth. Offer what is, not what you might hope will be, unless you clearly define the difference. It’s okay to say that, with the potential addition of this particular candidate, we hope to be able to expand our educational investment opportunities. We don’t have a timeline on that, but that is our clear hope, though not present today. Candidates appreciate the truth. They don’t want to feel snookered.

Secondly, anything that is offered in the interviewing process is up for grabs in the accountability game. A candidate should be able to ask when they might expect an update, should they accept a position with the organization, as to when these pieces hoped for are planned or are happening. Open-ended hopes will likely become closed-ended bitterness within the first six months of employment. By establishing timelines for check-in wrapped in accountable practices for delivery, the new employee has a clearly defined expectation to hold you to.

Thirdly, never underestimate the power of a realistic job preview. Offer the candidate to speak to employees who may not be part of the decision-making process. In fact, have the candidate speak to a champion as well as one who may not be overly enamored of the company (don’t tell me they aren’t in your company; they are). This is the most holistic view they can get. By putting those conversations forward as an option in the process, the candidate gets a strong sense that you’re not trying to hide behind something. Proactive transparency is attractive to candidates.

Promises aren’t the enemy; it’s the delivery and the follow-through. Can you confidently stand behind what you have just promised? Is it a real possibility or is it wishful thinking? You know which one it is; don’t lie to yourself, and certainly don’t lie to the candidate.

<!-- Source: I Think It’s Love: Planning for More Than an Emotional Organizational Connection During Hiring | 2023-04-04 17:07:09 | https://blog.humareso.com/ithinkitslove | ithinkitslove -->
!Humareso Blog Posts-15-LoveI had the chance to watch a rerun of The Love Boat recently. Yes, Pluto TV and I are good friends. I get to watch lots of old programming (The Price is Right – The Barker Years is a particular treat), and I often have an episode with the Pacific Princess playing on a Sunday afternoon while I prep for the week ahead. The guest stars are absolutely amazing. Don’t scoff. Take a peek at the long list of A-listers that rubbed elbows with the D-Listers. On this particular episode, Eddie Mekka played a high school friend of “Julie, Your Cruise Director” (it’s a requirement to say it together) who, within 30 seconds of being on the ship, sees the love of his life. He didn’t speak to her. He hadn’t heard her voice. He just saw her from afar and decided that she was “the one.” And, of course, in true Love Boat fashion, that three-day cruise, after some fumbling and lying, proved his wish to be granted. He and Audrey Landers left the boat with plans to marry. See? Easy.  
  
It got me thinking about how we approach career opportunities in a similar fashion. We look to fall in love and to do so quickly.  
  
Be honest. Haven’t you walked into an interview or logged onto your video appointment hoping to get “that feeling?” It’s not to say that you don’t care about the work, the community or the structure of the organization. It’s just that you might want to get the butterflies in your belly first.  
  
Walking in holistically prepared for that interview (throughout the whole process, actually) is likely the best way to avoid a sensory-biased decision-making process. Have a plan of engagement which includes your perspectives and questions based upon some legwork you’ve done regarding the company’s work, history, reviews, cultural insights, etc. Remember, this is an interview for the organization as much as it is for you.  
  
I am in the throws of some hiring now. Truthfully, I am keeping track of the approach. Less than 8% of those I am interviewing ask any questions…at all. I specifically leave time towards the end of the interview to invite the asking of anything about the organization. More than 90% of the time, the interviewee says something like, “Thank you, but I don’t have any questions. I just want to say how excited I am about this opportunity.”  
  
Look, I love that people want to work with the awesome team that’s been assembled (Avengers!), but there should be things about the company that you would want to know. Ask about the organization’s commitment to excellence in its work. Ask about how an equitable environment has been created and fostered (and if it’s not yet there, ask about what the hold up is). Ask about why this role is open. If it’s an additional role, ask how it was determined that this was the right time to add. If it’s a replacement role, ask why the previous employee moved out of the job. Ask about the manner with which investment in the persons of the company are made, not just in benefits (certainly including this, though), but also in areas of competency development, work-life integration, community involvement and the like.  
  
This prep work will balance out the emotional desire to “just know” that this is the right place for your next role. There is nothing wrong with enjoying a stroll around the deck in the moonlight while wearing a chiffon gown. However, the engine room, the laundry room and the staff quarters are just as important to get a true view if you’re planning on investing yourself on that ship.

<!-- Source: Needle in a Haystack: Finding Candidates through Passive Sourcing | 2023-08-16 14:15:00 | https://blog.humareso.com/passive-sourcing | passive-sourcing -->
Finding qualified candidates is a constant desire of businesses. It’s like finding a needle in a haystack sometimes. How to best do it has been up for debate, but the numbers are showing a clear winner. 73% of potential candidates are passive job seekers. That means the majority of candidates are coming from an organization’s research to find and the consistent labor it takes to connect to a candidate who doesn’t know they’re a candidate…yet. This passive sourcing is the technique of the wise organization who wants to be proactive while maintaining the competency levels needed to successfully perform the work.

But there is a second-tier statistic that really hammers the perspective home. Out of those 73% of potential candidates, 87% are open to the new job opportunity proposed. The vast majority of those sought out and connected to are not only willing to hear about the role, but they are most likely to accept an invitation to join the candidate pool for the job. The idea of “posting and praying” through Indeed, or the like, seems to pale in comparison to these stats.

How are you equipping passive sourcing to happen in your organization? Is it even a consideration for your team? Before you say yes, consider this: if you think that LinkedIn is your passive sourcing strategy, there are entire segments of the working population that don’t use or minimally use that platform with any regularity. It is most difficult to passively source someone on a platform of limited, if not no, active use. Think manufacturing, restaurant, retail, hotel and other industries. Not every pro uses that one platform.

What about the question of using AI to recruit and to source? It is possible, but like any product, it is dependent upon being fed information to activate robustly. When an organization does not use passive sourcing, whether at all or not very much, then those same novices are being tasked with building the input for any AI or machine learning software. Who is teaching your team in order for them to teach the robots?

Finding those resources to help your organization compete in a heavily passive market is vital for the success of any recruitment program. There can be no mistaking the utilization needed.

In the classic movie, Josh Baskin (Tom Hanks) wishes to grow up. His wish comes true, thanks to Zoltar. As he navigates this new existence as an adult, he gets a job and moves into an NYC apartment. Baskin is discovered by the MacMillan Toy Company owner (Robert Loggia) at FAO Schwartz. MacMillan is impressed and is sourced to come be a part of a new marketing campaign which ultimately leads to Baskin’s promotion to VP of Product Development. Not bad for a 12-year-old.

Mr. MacMillan went to where the best people would be – the toy store. He sourced from those experienced in toys and sought their input. Baskin didn’t know he would wind up with that role, but he was open to the opportunity. This is how passive sourcing works. It takes time, creativity and patience, but the end result works.

The struggle today is that many companies don’t have the time or the staff to engage with passive sourcing fully. It is difficult to just dip your toe into that pool and expect great results. A good idea without the resources to put into it remains a good idea; it just doesn’t become an activated good idea.

There are organization, and pique interest enough to get that person into the candidate pool. Easy? Nope. Time-Consuming? Yup. However, all research continues to point to passive sourcing as being the most pronounced method of recruitment to use.
