Surface them, then decide what to codify and what to retire.","2025-08-13 13:15:24","2025-08-13T13:17:06.344Z","<p>Every workplace runs on two sets of rules. There are the official policies - polished, lawyered, tucked neatly into the handbook - and then there are the rules everyone actually lives by: the unwritten, unvoted, quietly enforced norms that shape who gets opportunities, whose voice carries, and how decisions really get made. No one wrote them. Everyone feels them. And, left unexamined, they more accurately define your organizational culture than any value statement framed in the lobby.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Shadow policies often appear deceptively practical: “Real work happens during shared 'core' hours.” “Stretch projects go to people who've already shown they ‘get it.’” “Run this by Mark first; if he’s good, we’re good.” They can also read like suggestions instead of edicts&nbsp;- ""you might want to rethink taking&nbsp;PTO in Q4,"" or ""no need to loop in Legal before you’ve pre-sold the answer,"" or ""might not be a good move to&nbsp;contradict the top sales earner in public"" – and woe to the unfortunate soul who does!</p>
<p>Some started as helpful shortcuts. Many hardened over time into invisible gatekeeping. And <strong>all</strong> of them siphon energy when employees must take the time to decode top-secret company etiquette before they can make a move.</p>
<h4><span style=""font-family: Marion; font-weight: bold;"">Finding the Shadow Policies</span></h4>
<p>Spotting a shadow policy is part anthropology and part pattern recognition. Start with the moments that move people, process and (company) politics. What stalls or accelerates work and careers? How are “prestige” items - stretch assignments, travel, budget, visibility - determined? When a decision is “made in the meeting,” which conversations shaped it earlier, elsewhere … and with whom?</p>
<p>You may want to listen for phrases that signal an unwritten rule is standing in for a real policy. “<em>It’s better if you socialize this first”</em> can be a smart nudge - or code for <em>“the answer is predetermined so don’t even bother coming up with your suggestion.”</em> <em>“We don’t do that here” </em><strong>might </strong>protect quality…but it could just as easily be the ghost of a 2018 failure that has nothing to do with today’s reality.</p>
<p>Shadow policies thrive (and multiply) in silence, and identifying these “hidden” policies is about putting on your detective cap and seeking to swap folklore for clarity.</p>
<h4><span style=""font-family: Marion; font-weight: bold;"">Match Game</span></h4>
<p>It’s important to connect what people say is/should be happening with what the data shows or what you see playing out in real life. Why is Lucy organizing all the team offsites even though it isn’t her job? How is it that Glen’s team always lands the high-visibility projects?</p>
<p>Furthermore, we need to watch for the macro signals that there may be a drift between company slogans and company reality:</p>
<ul style=""font-size: 20px;"">
<li><span style=""font-family: Marion; font-weight: 400;"">we tout “flexible work” on our careers page yet praise 12 hours days and midnight emails</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: Marion;"">we list “open” and “collaborative” as company values, yet every department head hoards information inside their own kingdom</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: Marion;"">we encourage employees to use their PTO …but side-eye anyone who does</span></li>
</ul>
<p>And when, finally, these “shadow rules” see the light of day, it means that leaders must first acknowledge them and then either accept them with purpose,,,or retire them with grace.</p>
<h4><span style=""font-family: Marion; font-weight: bold;"">Should you Codify or Kill? </span></h4>
<p>Of course not&nbsp;every unwritten rule is a villain. Some are useful norms that got lost on the way to documentation - like&nbsp;“share meeting agendas 24 hours in advance” or “discuss contracts with Cindy in Finance before committing to a customer discount.” Others are one-offs that somehow became the company gospel, and so we maintain an outdated process while pretending to be efficient.</p>
<p>To help you determine what should stay and what should go, ask yourself these questions:</p>
<ul style=""font-size: 24px;"">
<li><span style=""font-family: Marion; font-weight: 400; font-size: 20px;"">Does it create clarity? If the norm helps people work faster with fewer surprises, that’s a point&nbsp;toward codify. If it breeds guesswork, it leans kill.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: Marion; font-size: 20px;"">Is it equitable in practice, not just theory? Check who benefits. If a norm concentrates opportunity in a familiar circle, it’s likely a problem no matter how “neutral” it sounds.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: Marion; font-size: 20px;"">Can it be explained without euphemism? If you need code words - “culture fit,” “executive presence,” “knows the business” - you might have a proxy for bias.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: Marion; font-size: 20px;"">Does it reduce risk without throttling learning? Guardrails are good. Invisible tripwires are not.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: Marion; font-size: 20px;"">Would you be comfortable writing it down? If naming it makes you flinch? That’s instructive and a big old yikes…and a sign to kill.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>If a shadow policy passes the test, codify it minimally and visibly. If it fails, kill it cleanly (this may take more than just an announcement!) and replace it with a visible and better alternative that leaders will model on day one.</p>
<p>The end state isn’t a world without any shadows; we’re humans and we will always improvise. But our goal should be to bring enough of that which is hidden into the light so that employees don’t need a decoder ring before they can contribute, grow, and make decisions.</p>
<p>So name the rules everyone follows. Codify the ones that make the work truer and faster and kill the ones that shrink possibility or rely on nostalgia to justify inclusion. And when in doubt, apply the simplest standard of all: <strong>if it needs secrecy to survive, it shouldn’t. </strong></p>{{ include_custom_fonts({""Elza"":[""Black"",""Black Italic"",""Bold"",""Bold Italic"",""Light"",""Light Italic"",""Medium"",""Medium Italic"",""Regular"",""Regular Italic"",""Semi Bold"",""Semi Bold Italic""],""Marion"":[""Bold"",""Regular"",""Regular Italic""]}) }}","https://cdn.humareso.com/hubfs/Blog%20Post.png","","PUBLISHED","false"

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hate. Just typing that word stops me in my tracks.</p>
<p>For the past few weeks, the number of online posts speaking to hate/haters seems to be spiking. Whether it be business owners who can’t keep up with the negative Yelp or Glassdoor reviews, or “Influencers” deluged with anti-fan commentary, or HR and TA practitioners finding themselves in the crosshairs of an <a href=""https://blog.humareso.com/dontrainonmyparade"">online battle</a> they didn’t sign up for, we are seeing many people stressed in response to hate.</p>
<p>And we know the difference between hate and calling someone or something out, right? If your organization supports discriminatory practices, then you can expect to hear about it through a variety of platforms. Discrimination, harassing environments or taking advantage of marginalized people will be called out, as it should be, and those in positions of power in those specific organizations can expect that to come. We live in a world where outrage over those truths will come to light quickly.</p>
<p>Individually, that type of correction does not need to be hateful, but it is certainly going to feel unwelcome. The discipline to change can be received as hate, but the fact is that when your organization is traveling down a wrong path, it will be called out. You should be prepared for that.</p>
<p>On the other hand, and more relevant to recent events, we have people feeling torn up by the unwelcome commentary about their work ethic, their work product and their assumed work performance. For some people, posting online about their work is part of their brand and their marketing strategy. The negative can come in response to one of those posts. Some will respond right under the post mocking your perspective and assuming your frame of reference. Some may quote your post on their page to blast you and tell their audience how dumb you are. Some negativity has also come behind the scenes – reaching out to an event planner to dissuade them from working with you, for instance.</p>
<p>And some of you might say, “Well, if they are going to post, then they have to be ready for all the responses – good and bad.” You would be right. You do have to be ready. Where I think we may be off course a bit, though, is when we go for the jugular of that person. If you don’t like the way someone markets their recruiting efforts, then you can banter about philosophies and approaches, but to go after their role as an employee for a company, or as a mother, or as a human is too far.</p>
<p>So, what do we do? First, if you are going to share your work online, get ready for the pushback. In the United States, in particular, most people operate as armchair quarterbacks. The “expertise” that people believe they have is astounding. To that end, the brazenness to be that “expert” on social media can often be cruel; the studies on “<a href=""https://www.kqed.org/education/532334/is-the-internet-making-you-meaner"">toxic disinhibition</a>” are insightful. We just need to be ready for those types to jump in and be unkind.</p>
<p>Secondly, those who post and share their work need to toughen up a bit. If you are going to walk into a Cyber Colosseum, so to speak, then you need your armor on. It is a battle, and hate is the oft-used weapon of your opponent. The battle preparation for you will consist of grounding – what do you believe in&nbsp;and how does that help to identify you? Lean into the truths of who you know you are, despite the random name-calling coming at you. The more you are grounded, the less impactful the&nbsp;hate will be.</p>
<p>This blog is a tough one to write. I tend to operate with a glass-half-full mentality. I don’t want to give hate more press than it already has. But there are real people who are falling apart. I am seeing and hearing accounts of these attacks online, including DMs to their bosses, colleagues, and yes, even to their adult children.</p>
<p>Let’s take a few moments to check in on our colleagues. This work is hard. Those standing up for others and for ideals need support. Those working hard to build a brand need support. Those trying to improve themselves need support. We can be more committed to that and learn better how to let the effects of hate roll off our backs.</p>

"Humareso Blog","Hire With Clarity: Acknowledge Today’s Culture, Build Tomorrow’s","Hire With Clarity: Acknowledge Today’s Culture, Build Tomorrow’s","en","https://blog.humareso.com/hire-with-clarity-acknowledge-todays-culture-build-tomorrows","Robin Schooling","Talent Strategy,hiring","Hire with clarity by showcasing your current culture and articulating your aspirational vision - recruit candidates ready to shape today and tomorrow.","2025-07-10 13:40:20","2025-07-10T13:40:20.547Z","<p>I remember an HR Department all-day meeting at a “challenging” organization where I worked. There we were, clustered around a conference room table with coffees in hand, dissecting every facet of the company’s hiring process and employee experience - from employer branding to onboarding rituals.</p>
<!--more--><p>We needed to cut straight to the heart of the matter - why did so many new hires vanish after one, three, or six months? So many. So so many. Like ghosts escaping back into the underworld.</p>
<p>It was due to – everyone finally realized – a disconnect of epic proportions.</p>
<h4><strong>When It Doesn’t Make Sense</strong></h4>
<p>The uncomfortable truth is that too often, companies recruit for the culture they aspire to rather than the culture they live. And that gap - between aspiration and reality - becomes the breeding ground for both misaligned expectations and early departures.</p>
<p>You can’t ignore the quirks of your existing environment. If your workplace quietly rewards perfectionism over collaboration, or if every decision must wend its way through six layers of approval, new hires will sense it immediately. No amount of marketing copy about “agile innovation” will mask the reality of daily stand-up meetings that feel like marathon lectures. And when companies gloss over these truths, they end up with frustrated employees who wonder, “Was I sold a story?”</p>
<p>Yet – of course - vision is critical. Without aiming toward a future state, culture stagnates and innovation grinds to a halt. Who wants to work for a company that dreams of rapid experimentation and creative risk-taking but evaluates every project by traditional ROI metrics first established in 1987? Even the boldest candidate will struggle if the day-to-day doesn’t support the aspiration. Recruiting purely for the culture you want, without acknowledging what <strong>is </strong>– today! now! - sets everyone up for disappointment.</p>
<h4><strong>Make it Make Sense</strong></h4>
<p>The solution lies in embracing both perspectives – the reality of today and the dreams for tomorrow - simultaneously. First, <a href=""https://humareso.com/hr-services"">conduct a candid appraisal of your present culture</a>. Gather a cross-section of voices - from tenured veterans to recent hires - and invite them to describe everyday experiences. What unwritten norms shape collaboration? Which rituals bolster morale, and which routines feel rote? This exercise isn’t about scoring “culture points” or getting some sort of “score” you can share with the Executive Team, but rather it’s about illuminating the landscape you inhabit day to day.</p>
<p>Next, define the contours of your desired culture. If your goal is a climate of continuous learning, identify what that looks like in practice. Perhaps it means allocating time for peer coaching or hosting internal “innovation weeks” when teams prototype ideas free from bureaucracy. If you aim for more transparent leadership, imagine regular town-hall dialogues where questions aren’t screened out. And then, by anchoring each of these aspirations in concrete behaviors, you can begin to turn those lofty ideals into tangible benchmarks.</p>
<p>With these dual diagnostics in hand, craft recruitment messaging that marries honesty with ambition. For example: a job posting can acknowledge the current pace - <strong>“<em>Our quarterly planning process still relies on manual spreadsheets”</em> </strong>- while promising active initiatives to automate and streamline – <strong>“<em>We’ve chartered a cross-functional Innovation Circle to change our operational model.”</em></strong></p>
<p>Then, during interviews, talk about this! invite candidates to reflect on similar transitions they’ve navigated and ask them they helped their teams evolve? What signals did they look for to gauge progress? These conversations become a preview of both your organizational journey <strong>and </strong>their potential employee experience.</p>
<h4><strong>Welcome to the Jungle</strong></h4>
<p>Onboarding then becomes the crucible for aligning realities and aspirations. Rather than a series of orientation slides, design immersive experiences that reveal both where you are and where you’re going. Pair new hires with “culture navigators” who can illuminate unwritten rules and champion emerging practices. Solicit feedback early - within the first t2 weeks! - about the surprises new hires have encountered and solicit their suggestions for improvement.</p>
<p>Of course, cultural transformation is not a one-off project/check-list exercise – it’s ongoing. Schedule recurring check-ins, skip-level “listening tours,” peer-review circles, and pulse surveys that monitor both satisfaction and alignment. Celebrate milestones: the first successful “innovation week,” the rollout of a real-time feedback tool. And when pilots don’t yield expected results, share those setbacks candidly. Vulnerability fosters trust far more effectively than feigned perfection ever could.</p>
<h4><strong>Living in the Middle</strong></h4>
<p>Ultimately, hiring for culture is neither a binary choice nor a static exercise. It requires a clear-eyed view of the here-and-now and a compelling vision of the next chapter. By acknowledging your present ecosystem while articulating the behaviors you’re evolving toward, you create a narrative that attracts candidates who not only fit today’s mold but are energized by the prospect of shaping tomorrow’s.</p>
<p>So, the next time you draft that job ad or plan your interview questions, ask yourself: am I painting a portrait of reality? And am I inviting others to help me refine that portrait into the masterpiece I know it can become? That tandem of honesty and aspiration is what can transform hiring the right team members from merely a transactional exchange into a future-focused strategy - and it’s the best way to close the loop between the culture you have and the culture you want.</p>
<p>Because you <strong>can</strong> do both: hire for where you are and where you’re headed.</p>
<p>The best teams are built <strong>not</strong> by pretending everything is already perfect … but by inviting people who want to help you make it better.</p>

Explore the trends reshaping HR’s role from compliance cop to strategic enabler of business success.","2025-06-30 14:59:28","2025-06-30T17:30:27.791Z","<p>This week, thousands upon thousands of HR professionals are packed into ballrooms in San Diego for <a href=""https://annual.shrm.org/"">#SHRM25</a>, collectively pondering what’s next for the field. What’s required? What’s at risk? What do we need to master to stay relevant in an era of unrelenting flux?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>And while it can feel like we’re <strong>always</strong> talking about the “future of HR,” this is not HR reinventing itself every few years. Rather, it’s about HR evolving. It’s about shedding the layers of outdated <em>function-as-identity</em> thinking and stepping into what the work demands of us now.</p>
<p>The future of Human Resources is not a singular destination – a train station where we disembark and have thus completed our journey. The future of HR is constant movement – a shift shaped by business needs, human behavior, and the steady, loud, and insistent drumbeat of disruption.</p>
<p>One thing is very clear, though - HR’s role isn’t to support from the sidelines, but rather to be central to <strong>how</strong> value gets created in our organizations. What does this look like? Here, as I see it, are the transformational shifts reshaping <strong>how</strong> we practice HR in 2025:</p>
<h2><strong>From Process to Purpose</strong></h2>
<p>The demand for lean, strategy-driven HR is not just about cost containment - it’s about speed, clarity, and intentionality. A future-focused HR function embraces nimbleness by fostering experimental and incremental change. Long, cumbersome transformation programs are giving way to agile interventions and continuous improvement.</p>
<p>Agile interventions might look like small-scale pilots to test new scheduling models, just-in-time pulse surveys to gather feedback mid-project, or cross-functional sprints to prototype elements of the employee experience. These fast, iterative efforts allow HR to respond to change without waiting for a slow-moving overhaul.</p>
<p>“Lean” also means&nbsp;simplifying with intent and letting go of legacy habits. This requires a relentless interrogation of the status quo:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-family: Marion; font-weight: 400; font-size: 22px;"">Do we still need this process?</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: Marion; font-size: 22px;"">What does it add?</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: Marion; font-size: 22px;"">Are we doing things because they matter - or because they’re habitual?</span></li>
</ul>
<p>HR needs to stop mistaking activity for impact.</p>
<h2><strong>Tech + Business Fluency</strong></h2>
<p>HR can no longer afford to view technology as a siloed system of record. The tools we use - ATS, LMS, <a href=""https://humareso.com/perform"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">performance</a> platforms - must be integrated into the broader language of business. That means HR should know the difference between what’s efficient, what’s effective, and what drives outcomes.</p>
<ul style=""font-size: 22px;"">
<li><span style=""font-family: Marion; font-weight: 400;"">Efficiency measures how quickly and cost-effectively we work – task workflows, time to fill, training completion, etc.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: Marion;"">Effectiveness speaks to quality - how we develop talent, <a href=""https://humareso.com/engage"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">engage</a> employees, and manage performance.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: Marion;"">Outcomes reflect whether HR is advancing the business agenda - boosting profitability, enabling productivity, and unlocking growth.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>To prepare for what’s next, HR must develop a measurement system aligned with business priorities, and can start by asking the question:” <em>What outcomes matter to our organization?”</em> Then, and only then, can we build effective and purposeful people strategies (incorporating appropriate technology!) that drive those outcomes.</p>
<p>This can’t, obviously, be done in isolation. HR must work in lockstep with Finance, Operations, and Strategy teams to define what “impact” truly means. When those outcomes are co-owned, the data becomes more credible - and the solutions more actionable.</p>
<h2><strong>Redefining the Work Deal</strong></h2>
<p>In the wake of massive global disruption, the fundamental relationship between employers and employees was rewritten, and the implicit deal between employers and employees has shifted. Flexibility, purpose, and transparency are no longer perks - they’re expectations. But this isn’t a one-way relationship; productivity and performance still matter. HR sits at this delicate intersection, charged with creating work environments that are both human-centric <strong>and </strong>results-driven.</p>
<p>That means acknowledging the person behind the employee ID, while also designing roles, systems, and incentives that support high performance. The future of HR requires fluency in both empathy <strong>and</strong> economics.</p>
<h2><strong>HR as Change Agent</strong></h2>
<p>HR’s traditional orientation toward risk mitigation has served its purpose - but it can no longer be the singular default lens through which all decisions are made. The cost of stasis is higher than the cost of change.</p>
<p>Yes, <a href=""https://humareso.com/hr-services"">compliance matters</a>. Yes, policy frameworks are necessary. But the future of HR lies in enabling forward motion, not arresting it. This means letting go of outdated norms that hold organizations back in the name of control, and instead guiding them toward smart, ethical risk-taking.</p>
<h2><strong>Owning the Experience</strong></h2>
<p>From onboarding to exit, HR owns the employee experience. That includes the moments of transition, the systems employees interact with daily, and the culture that surrounds them. The future of HR demands mastery over both the structural (tech, process, design) and the emotional (trust, inclusion, purpose).</p>
<p>The quality of the employee experience is also a direct contributor to retention, productivity, and employer brand. In a competitive talent landscape, EX isn’t just about engagement - it’s a strategic differentiator that influences who joins, who stays, and how they perform.</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p><a href=""https://robinschooling.com/real-hr-the-book-launch/"">HR <em>is</em> the business</a>. It maps talent to value, designs human-centered systems, and enables organizations to thrive in complexity.</p>
<p>And HR’s moment isn’t coming sometime in “the future.”</p>
<p>It’s here right now – and demanding more of us than ever.</p>{{ include_custom_fonts({""Elza"":[""Black"",""Black Italic"",""Bold"",""Bold Italic"",""Light"",""Light Italic"",""Medium"",""Medium Italic"",""Regular"",""Regular Italic"",""Semi Bold"",""Semi Bold Italic""],""Marion"":[""Bold"",""Regular"",""Regular Italic""]}) }}","https://cdn.humareso.com/hubfs/Thriving%20in%20Complexity.png","","PUBLISHED","false"

<p>The only way forward is progress, a rousing sentiment. But I have seen the opposite be the way forward—regress. Falling behind, disastrous choices, infighting, broken processes…shall I continue? We likely all have experienced some of this. Do we forego the pithy sentiment about progression?</p>
<p>The objective motivator is the individual contribution by each, not by all. Sentiment becomes watered down when it’s generalized to all. We all know that “Hang in There” cat poster (thank you to that awesome show, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Middle_(TV_series)""><strong>The Middle</strong></a>, for memorializing it for posterity). When delivered to the whole, it is simply positive sentiment without real direction. However, when delivered to an individual, it becomes personal. What do I need to do in order to hang in there? The individual delivery is meant to be thought-provoking and encouraging.</p>
<p>When it comes to <a href=""https://blog.humareso.com/the-logical-song"">progress</a>, the same objective can be offered specifically. The only way forward is progress as an individualized objective pushes the receiver to consider what that person can do as well as what is needed in order to do so. That’s progress. Walking into a department and saying, “Do Better” is generalized. A manager should not expect a team member to rise to the occasion after such a broad admonition. The path of least resistance is to say to one’s self, “I am doing the better. It’s everyone else.” And that is most often the end of the line of “motivation.”</p>
<p>Instead, if a department needs to do better, seek to address the individuals. The opening mandate to all may set the stage for what’s to come, but it’s the one-on-one dialogue that will bring to light those reflective considerations.</p>
<p>“Joe, the organization needs us to do better. What do you see as being an area of improvement we should address? How can you help to address that suggestion, and what will that take for you to do so?” This might be the purest way to start an individual check-in. And lest you think that each person will automatically say, “Oh, it’s me. I am the problem and will change my evil ways immediately,” (we’re so bitter, aren’t we?) it may take a moment or two for someone to get beyond the reason why it’s actually Marty’s fault that everything is crap. With some gentle, consistent questions, Joe will begin to think personally. “Well, Marty is part of the problem. I can see that we’ve become less motivated to do a great job. We have become okay with a passable job.” Those we-statements are code for I-statements, often done due to a lack of organizational trust or out of fear from previous interactions. Meet that person in those illuminating moments by affirming the perspective and asking to understand more deeply.</p>
<p>It is not easy for a first-time supervisor to draw out such reflection from a team. It takes practice. If you are a first-time manager, give yourself some grace.</p>
<p>And to those of you who get asked about progression and how you can participate, participate. Talk to your supervisor. Be gracious, thoughtful, and innovative. You do not need to be a doormat to do that. Focus on what you can do first. Or, I guess you could respond like Axl from <strong>The Middle</strong>, “…Together we are awesome. But alone, only I am still awesome.”</p>

Embracing workplace change is essential for growth, relevance, and sustainability..","2025-06-04 14:05:01","2025-06-04T14:09:32.306Z","<p style=""font-size: 20px;""><img src=""https://21594889.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21594889/Standing%20Still%20While%20Others%20Move-1.png"" width=""2240"" height=""1260"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Standing Still While Others Move-1"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 2240px;"">Stillness has its moments. A mime frozen in place. A street performer playing statue. Stillness as spectacle - admirable precisely because it defies the momentum of everything around it.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">But in today’s workplace? Stillness isn’t performance art. It’s professional decay.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">The tempo of change is no longer a manageable rhythm. It’s a thumping bassline; powered by AI, shifting talent markets, and rising expectations. And if you’re not in motion, you’re not just idling in “neutral” – you may, in fact, be falling behind.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">Think about this…<!--more--></p>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">Flashback to 1999 when everyone was slapping GIFs on splash pages and hiring “webmasters.” The Internet felt novel, and digital transformation meant getting everyone an email address and convincing leaders that, yes, people <strong><em>would</em></strong> apply for jobs online.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">Today? We've moved from building websites to building predictive models. We’re now wondering how our remote workforce can be productive when we have teams distributed across four time zones and six Slack channels. We’ve learned that AI does more than just assist with every-day tasks and make wonky pictures, so many of us have pivoted to refining prompts and contemplating how AI&nbsp;Agent #1 can hand off a task to AI Agent #2.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">This isn’t about being “trendy.” It’s about survival in a workplace where adaptability is the cost of doing business.</p>
<h4><strong>The Technology Treadmill: Run or Be Replaced</strong></h4>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">Technology has always been a lever for transformation. Remember the “paperless office” promises of the 1980s (or at least hearing about them)? Folks didn’t just aim to reduce the number of filing cabinets - they rewrote entire workflows. The same is happening now, <a href=""https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/01/ai-2025-workplace/#:"">but <strong>infinitely</strong> faster</a> - and often without warning.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">In progressive orgs, <span style=""color: red;""><a href=""https://humareso.com/perform"">performance feedback is continuous</a></span>, career development is driven by real-time data (not five-year plans), and learning is modular, personalized, and increasingly <span style=""color: red;""><a href=""https://humareso.com/engage"">gamified</a></span>. Some teams experiment with <a href=""https://www.takeaway-reality.com/post/virtual-reality-employee-training"">VR training modules</a> and digital twins while other organizations still treat new employee orientation as a full day of passive PowerPoint consumption (with doughnuts!).</p>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">If your company is still clinging to rigid structures and outdated norms, you’re not conserving tradition - you’re curating obsolescence. The workplace is constantly moving - toward skill adjacency, flexible work models, and human-centric design. If you’re still clinging to rigid schedules and templated job paths, you may as well be invisible.</p>
<h4><strong>Learn Like Beyoncé (Yes, Really)</strong></h4>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px; font-family: Marion; font-weight: 400;"">Beyoncé dropped <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/album/7dK54iZuOxXFarGhXwEXfF"">Lemonade</a> without warning - no teaser, no press release, just vulnerability, vision, and a direct line to her audience. In a similar way (though with far less glamour), employees today need to be agile creators of their own relevance.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px; font-family: Marion;"">Waiting for your LMS to tell you what to learn is like waiting for a rotary phone to ring. If you're not actively scanning the horizon for what your industry is shifting toward - whether that’s AI literacy, ethical leadership, or data fluency - you will get left behind.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px; font-family: Marion;"">And it’s not just about individual skills; teams, departments, and entire functions need to evolve. HR professionals who once focused solely on compliance are now expected to contribute to employee experience design, workforce planning, and predictive analytics. Finance leaders are now fluent in ESG. And marketing has become data-driven to a degree that would have baffled anyone twenty years ago.</span></p>
<h4><strong>Movement Is Strategy</strong></h4>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">Stillness in the workplace might feel safe - like the security of using the same process for the 14th quarter in a row. But it’s a comfort illusion – and in today’s world, comfort calcifies. It kills creativity, momentum, and, eventually, growth and sustainability.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">So move. Not wildly. Not aimlessly. But with intent.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">Take the workshop. Ask the question. Watch the webinar your brain keeps categorizing as “later.” Try the tool your colleague keeps raving about, even if the UI makes you break out in hives.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">Here are a few places to start:</p>
<ul style=""font-size: 20px;"">
<li><span style=""font-family: Marion; font-weight: 400;"">Review your job description. Does it describe what you do - or what you used to do? Update it.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: Marion; font-weight: 400;"">Schedule a learning hour every week. Block the calendar, no excuses.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: Marion;""><span style=""font-family: Marion; font-weight: 400;"">Reach out to someone in a different department and ask how their work has changed over the past two years. Then listen</span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">Inertia is easy. But inertia is also a choice - and not a neutral one.</p>
<h4><strong>The Workplace Isn't Waiting</strong></h4>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">Work, as we know it, is not just evolving - it’s fracturing and reforming in real-time. Roles are disappearing and reemerging, organizational charts are flattening, and performance is less about tenure and more about traction.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">So move. Learn. Stretch. Shift. Be the person who got curious…<strong><em>not</em></strong><em> the one who got left behind.</em></p>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">Because while you're standing still, the future isn't.</p>{{ include_custom_fonts({""Elza"":[""Bold"",""Bold Italic"",""Light"",""Light Italic"",""Medium"",""Medium Italic"",""Regular"",""Regular Italic"",""Semi Bold"",""Semi Bold Italic""],""Marion"":[""Bold"",""Regular"",""Regular Italic""]}) }}","https://cdn.humareso.com/hubfs/Standing%20Still%20While%20Others%20Move-1.png","","PUBLISHED","false"

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<!--more--><p>This week, I had the privilege of attending <strong>Workhuman Live 2025</strong>, and I’m walking away with a head full of insights and a heart full of inspiration. The event was a powerful reminder that, in the age of AI, agility, and accelerating change, what truly sets organizations apart is still deeply human: connection, courage, and culture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Elza; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: -0.02em; font-size: 24px; background-color: transparent;"">1. Human Data &gt; Skills Hype</span></p>
<p><strong>Jess VonBank</strong> from Mercer posed a provocative question: <em>“Are we over-rotating on skills architecture?”</em> It’s true—while organizations scramble to build skills-based systems, the reality is that skills are fluid, context-dependent, and notoriously hard to quantify. Fewer than 25% of HR leaders trust self-reported skills data, and AI-driven skills inference still misses the nuance of behavior.</p>
<p>Here’s the interesting twist: <strong>recognition data</strong>—those everyday moments when peers call out strengths—might just hold the key to understanding how skills actually show up in the real world. It’s not just about what people know; it’s about how they apply it, how others experience it, and how they grow over time.</p>
<p><strong style=""font-family: Elza, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: -0.02em; background-color: transparent;"">2. Resilience Is a Muscle You Build—One Rejection at a Time</strong></p>
<p>One of the most memorable sessions came from author and keynote speaker <strong>Alex Banayan</strong>, who broke down what he calls the <em>“Rejection Inspection.”</em> Rejection, he reminded us, is inevitable—but it doesn’t have to be defining.</p>
<p>His three-part framework offers a human-centered way to reframe failure:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-size: 20px;""><strong>Reset the system</strong> (go for a walk, take a nap, grab ice cream)</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: 20px;""><strong>Realign the navigation</strong> (remind yourself <em>why</em> you do this work)</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: 20px;""><strong>Reexamine the engine</strong> (question the story you're telling yourself)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The stories we tell ourselves—about our worth, our future, and our potential—shape everything. And in a field like HR, where we’re often the emotional engine of the organization, learning to process rejection with grace and grit is mission-critical.</p>
<p><strong style=""font-family: Elza, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: -0.02em; background-color: transparent;"">3. Curiosity Creates New Worlds</strong></p>
<p><strong><img src=""https://21594889.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21594889/Image%20(7).jpeg"" width=""334"" height=""526"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Image (7)"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 334px; float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 0px;"">Trevor Noah</strong> brought wisdom and wit to the stage, offering a powerful reflection on the role of curiosity in uncertain times. “Prepare for what you would like to do—even if that job doesn’t exist yet,” he said. In a world where AI is reshaping industries, and job descriptions are constantly evolving, this mindset is gold.</p>
<p>AI won’t solve everything, but it <em>will</em> create new possibilities. The key is to stay curious, keep asking better questions, and be ready to grow into spaces that don’t even exist yet.</p>
<p>One of the most recurring messages throughout the conference: <strong>show people what’s possible</strong>, not just what to do. Whether it's about building inclusive cultures, adopting new technologies, or bouncing back from setbacks, leaders who lead with transparency and vulnerability are the ones who drive real change.</p>
<p>Implicit messaging—what we <em>do</em>, not just what we <em>say</em>—has far more power than we often realize. If we want employees to be agile, open-minded, and resilient, we have to model that ourselves.</p>
<p>The future of work isn’t just about strategy or structure. It’s about storytelling, belonging, recognition, and resilience. So, as I head back to the day-to-day, I’m carrying with me a renewed sense of purpose—and a sticky note on my desk that says: <em>“Show people what’s possible.”</em></p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 16px;""><strong>“But First, Coffee,”</strong> hosted by John Baldino and Jackye Clayton, is a weekly livestreamed show that blends HR insight with authenticity, caffeine, and the occasional chaos of going live from an industry conference floor.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16px;"">Airing most Thursdays and running a full hour, the show draws in people leaders, recruiters, DEI advocates, founders, technologists, and executives who are tired of stiff, over-rehearsed HR content. Instead, they find something that feels more like a conversation over coffee - if your coffee date also featured surprise guests, spontaneous debates, and real talk about the state of work.</span></p>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 16px;""><strong>A Format That Percolates</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16px;"">The format is deliberately casual. Each hour-long episode begins with a familiar back-and-forth between Baldino and Clayton - banter, current events, and sometimes a surprise anecdote from the airport or the expo hall. Then the week’s theme takes center stage, whether it’s workplace culture, hiring trends, AI and automation, or how burnout is reshaping the workforce. </span><span style=""font-size: 16px;"">Occasionally, a guest joins the table - leaders like Hung Lee, Jennifer McClure, Torin Ellis, or a rotating cast of HR tech CEOs, authors, and rising voices in the space. But it’s just as likely the show is streamed <i>live</i> from an event like UNLEASH, WorkHuman, or SHRM, with the sound of conference chatter in the background and a fresh stack of branded swag in the corner.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16px;"">“We want it to feel like you just pulled up a chair next to us,” Clayton says. “This isn’t a keynote. This is a kitchen table moment - just with thousands of HR folks listening in.”</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Topical, Timely, and Just a Bit Toasted</strong></h3>
<p>What’s made <i>But First, Coffee</i> stand out is its tone. It’s irreverent, but informed. Funny, but fiercely relevant. Episodes feature titles like:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><i>“Time Management Tips to Avoid Burnout (With a Splash of Espresso)”</i><i></i></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>“Spring Clean Your Goals: Reassessing Priorities”</i><i></i></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>“Live from Transform: Brewing the Future of Work”</i><i></i></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>“The Swag Report: UNLEASH Recap Edition”</i><i></i></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>“Looking at Careers in HR - Where Do We Even Go From Here?”</i></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Topics cover everything from performance management and DEI to AI disruption and generational shifts. No two episodes are the same, but each one offers takeaway insights that HR professionals can bring back to their desks, teams, and strategies.</p>
<p>“It’s a mix of therapy, trendspotting, and storytelling,” Baldino explains. “We don’t shy away from what’s hard. But we also laugh - a lot.”</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><strong>A Show That Travels</strong></h3>
<p>Part of the magic is location. While many episodes are recorded remotely, <i>But First, Coffee</i> frequently goes live from the field. At UNLEASH America in Las Vegas, the team broadcasted from the expo floor, delivering interviews with vendors and attendees. At WorkHuman, they covered the theme of gratitude and belonging. From Nashville to NYC, the show’s mobile setup means the team can jump into the action, offering real-time recaps and first-look access to the conversations shaping the field.</p>
<p>“It’s basically the ‘HR CNN’ you didn’t know you needed,” one viewer commented on LinkedIn. “Except with better banter and cooler mugs.”</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><strong>Building a Community, Not Just an Audience</strong></h3>
<p>What began as a low-key livestream has become a gathering place for the HR community. With viewers tuning in live or catching the replay via LinkedIn, YouTube, or the podcast feed, <i>But First, Coffee</i> now reaches thousands of professionals each month. Some have built their Friday routines around it.</p>
<p>The show is also highly shareable. Clips, quotes, and graphics circulate on social throughout the week, often sparking debates or applause in the comments. Humareso’s marketing team pushes the momentum with weekly recaps, banner images, and even swag giveaways that keep the community engaged.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, production has scaled with intention - Restream powers the multi-platform broadcast, and Adobe Express supports the show’s branded visuals. But nothing is overly polished. That’s the point.</p>
<p>“This is a living-room-style talk show for people who live HR every day,” Clayton says. “And we’re not done brewing yet.”</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><strong>What’s Next?</strong></h3>
<p>Looking ahead, the team behind <i>But First, Coffee</i> is preparing to build out the ecosystem. Plans are underway for a dedicated landing page with a live calendar, guest signup, and newsletter. There’s talk of branded mugs, on-demand playlists, and a formal sponsor strategy.</p>
<p>But the core idea remains the same: deliver real, unfiltered conversations about the evolving world of work, with a little caffeine and a lot of heart.</p>
<p>Or as Baldino puts it: “You bring the coffee. We’ll bring the conversation.”</p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">If you’ve ever worked in a restaurant - or binge-watched <em>The Bear</em> - you’ve likely heard the phrase “<em>mise en place.”</em></span></p>
<!--more-->
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">It’s the backbone of any well-run kitchen. French for ""everything in its place,"" it represents more than just organizing tools and ingredients – it’s a mindset. Mise en place means preparing in advance - portions are measured, knives are sharpened, tools are ready. The groundwork is done before the pressure mounts so when the heat arrives, the team can operate with calm and precision.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Then there’s <em>mise en scene</em> - literally, “putting on stage.” It refers to the aesthetic and atmosphere: lighting, layout, ambiance, the elements that create the experience. Think of the warm glow over a dining room, the precision of the table setting, the seamless rhythm of service.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">One sets the system. The other sets the stage.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">In HR, both matter.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">*****</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">HR teams occasionally like to dive into strategy – items related to engagement, culture, performance - without shoring up the operational foundation to support these activities. The intention is there but the infrastructure may be absent.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Alternatively, attention may be given to appearances: a polished career page, aspirational culture statements, and a handful of well-placed perks. But, just as over in that restaurant, the employee experience suffers if the systems behind the scenes are unstructured or inconsistent.</span><span style=""font-size: 20px;""></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;""><strong>Mise en place in HR includes:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Clear, repeatable onboarding that isn’t reliant on memory or ad hoc reminders</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Offboarding processes that are comprehensive and respectful</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">PTO policies that are easy to access and interpret</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Documentation that is both relevant and consistently used</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">HRIS, payroll, and performance systems that integrate effectively</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Managers who have reliable access to guidance and tools without unnecessary delays</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">It’s about flow. Anticipating what’s needed before it’s urgent. Well-constructed operations create space for responsiveness and quality.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;""><strong>Mise en scène in HR includes:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-family: Marion; font-weight: 400; font-size: 20px;"">A physical and cultural environment that reflects your values</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: Marion; font-size: 20px;"">Communication practices that are purposeful and aligned</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: Marion; font-size: 20px;"">Structured experiences—from onboarding to performance management—that feel intentional, rather than reactive or scripted</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">When HR aligns both the operational foundation and the cultural experience, the result is noticeable. Employees find what they need with ease. Managers aren’t forced to reinvent process. Leaders can focus on vision and impact. The service feels seamless because the structure is sound.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">And just like a well-run kitchen, when everything is in its place, the experience speaks for itself.</span></p>{{ include_custom_fonts({""Elza"":[""Bold"",""Bold Italic"",""Light"",""Light Italic"",""Medium"",""Medium Italic"",""Regular"",""Regular Italic"",""Semi Bold"",""Semi Bold Italic""],""Marion"":[""Bold"",""Regular"",""Regular Italic""]}) }}","https://cdn.humareso.com/hubfs/Humareso%20Blog%20Posts-1-Master%20Chef%20Style.png","","PUBLISHED","false"

<p>Talent attraction is ambiguous. There are a series of questions that might help us to define a path towards it. What will it take to get a candidate to be drawn to what our organization has to offer? Is it compensation? Benefits? Mobility or flexibility? Advancement? Is it all this and more? So, how do you know what to focus on?</p>
<p>When Ross decided it was time for him to change his approach to dating (to be more attractive, to break out of his routine/brand), he purchased a pair of leather pants for a date. It is one of the more hilarious episodes of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXG6NvBRcrI""><strong>Friends</strong></a> as Ross experiences the discomfort in fit, temperature and flexibility in those pants while on that date. What started out as a stance on being different, relevant, attractive and engaging turned into awkwardness, discomfort, unattractiveness and failing to get him a second date.</p>
<p>Is your company trying to put on “leather pants” to attract talent? Sigh.</p>
<p>Ask your teams about the brand. Start with what you have access to – those who have aligned themselves to the organization. At a basic level, there is some attraction for that employee to be part of the company. Whether “it’s just a paycheck” or up to “I love it here,” there is feedback to start with in nailing down a talent attraction approach. Ask them what it would take to have someone take a second look at our company. Ask them why they did. Use that information to provide foundational components to the attraction strategy.</p>
<p>Leaving it to the executive team alone to determine why someone would want to be part of the organization is a flat, biased plan forward. If they are alone to reinvent the talent attraction and brand alignment approach, they often believe they have their fingers on the pulse. A recent <a href=""https://www.pwc.com/us/en/library/pulse-survey/finding-opportunity-in-business-reinvention.html"">PwC survey</a> of executives revealed that 76% of them “agree that they have the capabilities to execute business model changes at scale.” Now, think about that from an employee’s perspective. When they see physical plant issues (a toilet that’s been leaking for weeks, for instance) or organizational structure needs (job leveling, leadership approaches, compensation analytics, etc.) that have not been addressed, it causes doubt regarding the “capabilities” available to execute. Executives might think more highly of themselves than they ought.</p>
<p>The language around culture is also a limited approach. It is highly unlikely that a company would advertise: <em>“Come join us. We have a mediocre culture and we’re barely getting by”</em> (I don’t suggest this approach). Instead, we see an uninspiring tale of vibrant culture and inclusive opportunities. These messages become noise and lost in the sea of others saying the same. And further, incumbent employees see this and, if it isn’t quite true, double down on the liars that run the organization. That’s not the messaging that you want.</p>
<p>Talent attraction is a mix of cultural truths and brand management, yes, but it is also organizational opportunities, market penetration tactics, competency development and total rewards offerings. It is all of it which provides many messaging opportunities for talent acquisition, human resources and marketing teams to collaborate and to deliver.</p>
<p>Think about the messaging. What does it tell others about the organization? Hear it from the vantage point of someone who does not know anything or much about the company. Use friends and family at times to provide feedback on their impressions based on the messaging. And don’t be defensive about it! You want to hear those responses.</p>
<p>Lastly, stay authentic to what the company really is. Overpromising is a death sentence. Employees will share with a new employee, usually within the first week, as to what the truths are. The leather pants are not a lasting strategy. Take them off (er, wait a minute, that’s not what I meant).</p>

<p>Earlier this week, I had a horrible night. I could neither fall nor stay asleep. I woke up way too early, feeling unrefreshed, mad at the dog (who had been sprawled across my legs seemingly all night!),&nbsp;and in dire need of coffee.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Now I am, quite frankly, never a ray of sunshine first thing in the morning. But THAT morning? Oh, let me tell you… my glum mood hung around far too long and well into the afternoon my picture could have appeared in the dictionary next to the word “cranky.”</p>
<p>Now what if, perchance, my employer happened to roll out/open up an annual “engagement survey” on that particular day? And what if, because I was feeling particularly peevish, I decided to sit down and fill out the survey … on that day?</p>
<p>How might I have answered these fairly common questions we see on surveys of this type? On a scale of 1 (“never”) to 10 (“always”)?</p>
<p><strong>Question: Do you feel you have a good balance between your work and personal life?</strong><br><strong>Answer:</strong> No; I have had no sleep. <strong>Score: 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question: Do you feel motivated to do your best work every day?</strong><br><strong>Answer:</strong> Are you kidding me with this? I slept for 2 hours and can barely remember my name let alone put a coherent thought together. <strong>Score: 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question: How satisfied are you with your current role?</strong><br><strong>Answer:</strong> I want to fling myself off the nearest cliff and snuggle down in the field of wildflowers at the bottom and sleep for 3 days. <strong>Score: 1</strong></p>
<p>If this sounds a little extreme, well… it is. But also, it’s not.</p>
<h4><strong>People Be Peopling</strong></h4>
<p>What we sometimes forget when we launch our carefully structured engagement surveys is that people are not answering from a perfectly neutral space. They’re answering from <em>where they are</em> in that specific moment - physically, emotionally, and mentally. The responses we get are valid…but they’re also highly context dependent. And if we’re only asking once a year, we’re basing our entire strategy on data from what may be someone’s worst (or best) day ever.</p>
<p>Let’s break down how this often works - and we all know this…don’t we?</p>
<p>We roll out a shiny, well-branded employee engagement survey once a year. The questions are solid. We tell people it’s confidential. We post QR codes in the breakroom and give managers talking points. Then we sit back and wait for the data to roll in.</p>
<p>And then it does. And it tells us that things feel… okay. Not amazing. Not catastrophic. Just okay.</p>
<p>People say they’re mostly satisfied. They feel somewhat heard. They believe their manager is reasonably supportive. Maybe scores are up two points over last year, maybe they’re down a few. Either way, we make a plan, present it to the leadership team, and commit to revisiting the topic in… well, a year.</p>
<p><strong>But</strong> <strong>people don’t live their work lives on a 365-day cycle.</strong></p>
<p>An annual survey captures a snapshot - a single frame in a much longer film. And depending on what’s happening on the day someone responds, you may get a very distorted picture of reality. Maybe the AC is broken that day. Maybe a beloved coworker just left. Maybe someone just got promoted. These experiences color how people respond.</p>
<p>When you only ask once a year, you’re assuming people’s perceptions and experiences are fixed. But humans are anything but fixed.</p>
<p>We are situational. We are seasonal. We are affected by both the moment we’re in and the cumulative weight of many moments before it.</p>
<p>Want to truly understand how your people are doing? Ask more often. Even better - make it a habit.</p>
<h4><strong>Why Frequent Feedback Matters</strong></h4>
<p>Organizations that truly want to understand the employee experience need to stop treating feedback like a once-a-year audit. Instead, it should be viewed as an ongoing diagnostic - a regular check-in on what’s happening beneath the surface. The more frequently you ask, the more accurately you can see trends, shifts, and emerging issues <em>before</em> they become full-blown culture problems.</p>
<p>And no, this doesn’t mean you need to pester people with 50-question surveys every Monday. But a few well-placed pulse checks - monthly, quarterly, even event-triggered - can offer insight into the real-time employee mindset. Did we just launch a new return-to-office policy? Check in two weeks later. Big leadership shift? Ask how people are feeling. Don’t wait 11 more months to find out you missed the mark.</p>
<h4><strong>Designing Feedback for Real Humans</strong></h4>
<p>Here’s the thing about humans: we’re messy. We’re emotional. We’re reactive. And most of us don’t walk around in a state of perfectly measured objectivity. Which is exactly why annual surveys, while helpful for high-level benchmarking, often fail to capture the nuance of the <strong>everyday employee experience.</strong></p>
<p>Instead of asking people to summarize their entire year of work life in one sitting, try building a cadence that mirrors how people <em>actually</em> experience their jobs. Think quick check-ins. Think micro-feedback. Think prompts that feel like conversations, not compliance.</p>
<p>If someone is struggling with workload, frustrated with team dynamics, or thrilled about a new growth opportunity, it makes a difference when they have a timely space to say so. Not only does this validate their experience, but it creates <a href=""https://portal.humareso.com/hts/knowledge-base/knowledge-base/where-can-i-see-my-teams-engagement-scores-cultural-health"">opportunities for action</a> that are relevant <em>right now</em>, not twelve months from now when the moment has long passed.</p>
<h4><strong>From Checkboxes to Conversations</strong></h4>
<p>The goal isn’t to simply collect more data - it’s to create a culture of responsiveness. When employees know they can share how they’re doing, and that what they share actually gets seen, heard, and acted upon? That’s what builds trust.</p>
<p>Sometimes it’s a monthly open-text pulse. Sometimes it’s a super-easy <a href=""https://humareso.com/engage"">platform-enabled listening tool</a>. Sometimes it’s a question at the end of a team meeting. Sometimes it’s a ""How are we doing this week?"" Teams chat that encourages honest replies. The point is: consistency and intention beat flash and frequency.</p>
<p>And when people see follow-through - changes made, conversations had, ideas implemented - you <a href=""https://blog.humareso.com/what-you-dont-know-expectation-management-and-high-performance"">build a feedback loop</a> that doesn’t just <em>capture</em> sentiment.</p>
<p>It shapes it.</p>{{ include_custom_fonts({""Elza"":[""Bold"",""Bold Italic"",""Light"",""Light Italic"",""Medium"",""Medium Italic"",""Regular"",""Regular Italic"",""Semi Bold"",""Semi Bold Italic""],""Marion"":[""Bold"",""Regular"",""Regular Italic""]}) }}","https://cdn.humareso.com/hubfs/Humareso%20Blog%20Posts-2-Employee%20Feedback.png","","PUBLISHED","false"

<p>You know the feeling: your calendar looks like a game of Tetris, your inbox is spiraling, and your to-do list? It’s a scroll, not a list. You’re busy. Overloaded. And honestly, unsure where to even begin.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Welcome to modern work life, where full plates are worn like badges - and burnout is never far behind.</p>
<p>But let’s be clear: operational excellence doesn’t mean saying yes to everything. It means doing the right things, in the right way, at the right time. And when you’re buried under tasks, you need a way to cut through the noise.</p>
<p>Start with three questions:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Can I delegate it? Can I automate it? Can I eliminate it?</strong></p>
<p>These aren’t just nice-to-have concepts. They’re practical decision paths to help you move forward with focus.</p>
<h4><strong>Delegate: It Doesn’t Always Have to Be You</strong></h4>
<p>You don’t need to carry every task across the finish line. Delegation is about clarity - knowing where your time and energy are best spent, and where someone else might actually do it better (or faster).</p>
<p>If you’re in a leadership role, this is non-negotiable. Your job isn’t to micromanage - it’s to lead, prioritize, and create space for strategic thinking. So whether it’s prepping slides, managing the team offsite, or handling reporting cycles, ask: does this require <em>my</em> expertise, or can someone else take it on?</p>
<p>And yes, sometimes that “someone else” may not be in your org. If you or your team doesn’t have the bandwidth, <a href=""https://humareso.com/hr-outsourcing"">outsource it</a>. That’s not a shortcut - it’s smart operational strategy. Whether it’s admin tasks, HR functions, or specialized support, finding external partners who can execute efficiently lets you focus on what actually moves the business forward.</p>
<h4><strong>Automate: Streamline the Repeats</strong></h4>
<p>If you’re doing the same thing over and over, it’s time to ask: <em>why?</em></p>
<p>Automation doesn’t need to be flashy. It’s not always about big systems or fancy tools. Sometimes it’s just setting up smart workflows, using templates, or building in consistent processes.</p>
<p>Need to send onboarding materials to every new hire? Automate that. Regular reports? Build a dashboard. Meeting reminders? Let your calendar work for you.</p>
<p>The goal here isn’t to remove the human element. It’s to remove friction. Repetitive tasks can drain attention and time - two things in short supply when you’re overloaded.</p>
<p>Let automation do the routine work so you can do the work that requires judgment, creativity, or leadership.</p>
<h4><strong>Eliminate: Some Things Just Don’t Belong</strong></h4>
<p>Let’s talk about what <em>doesn’t</em> need to get done.</p>
<p>That meeting that’s been on the calendar since 2016 with no agenda and no real purpose? Cancel it. That report no one references but you keep compiling out of habit? Sunset it.</p>
<p>The more you eliminate the unnecessary, the more room you create for actual priorities. If a task or process no longer adds value, it’s clutter. Let it go.</p>
<p>This isn’t ruthless. It’s intentional. Operational excellence isn’t about being busy, it’s about being effective. And sometimes that starts with saying no.</p>
<h4><strong>Overload Isn’t a Performance Issue</strong></h4>
<p>If you’re feeling overwhelmed, it’s not because you’re failing - it’s often simply because you’re doing too much that doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>The delegate/automate/eliminate framework isn’t just tactical - it’s cultural. Leaders who model it give others permission to do the same which creates breathing room, clarity, and better outcomes.</p>
<p>So the next time your task list starts to feel like a losing battle, stop. Don’t power through. Step back and sort. Your time isn’t infinite. Use it where it counts.</p>
<p>Excellence doesn’t come from doing more. It comes from doing what matters - and letting go of the rest.</p>

<p>Too often, HR gets reduced to surface-level impressions - nice intentions, a knack for handling people issues, maybe a solid operational partner. But in today’s workplace? That’s not nearly enough.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>HR professionals must bring more than just good intentions and people skills to the table. To lead effectively and earn meaningful influence, they need to operate with a trio of qualities: <strong>capability</strong>, <strong>competence</strong>, and <strong>confidence</strong>. When HR shows up with all three, they gain credibility with leadership, earn trust with employees, and drive real organizational impact. Without them? HR risks being sidelined, second-guessed, or reduced to little more than party planners or policy police.</p>
<h4><strong>Capability</strong>: <strong>Knowing What Matters</strong></h4>
<p>Capability is about understanding the work at a strategic level as well as possessing the ability to <strong><em>do the work</em></strong><em>. </em> It’s knowing what’s required to support the business - not just today, but in the long run. That includes interpreting workforce data, navigating regulatory landscapes, and aligning people initiatives with broader business goals. Capability is rooted in knowledge and awareness of what’s required in the modern workplace.</p>
<p>Let’s say the business is struggling to attract candidates in a specific region. A capable HR pro doesn’t just run more job postings – a potentially futile effort. Rather, they analyze compensation benchmarks, assess employer brand perception, and advise leaders on things like adjusting hybrid work models to broaden the talent pool. An HR leader with capability can interpret labor market trends and translate that data into a competitive talent acquisition strategy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Competence</strong>: <strong>Delivering with Consistency</strong></h4>
<p>This is where knowledge meets execution - it’s about getting the job done with<em> <strong>skill and consistency</strong></em>. It’s about applying expertise effectively - especially when stakes are high. From managing complex employee relations cases to designing performance systems, competence ensures we deliver results that are aligned, ethical, and sound. Competence is what keeps organizations out of legal trouble - and ensures HR is operating as a partner in decision making.</p>
<p>For example, when a manager labels someone a “bad fit,” a competent HR professional doesn’t let that stand. They dig deeper, assess context, and ensure decisions are grounded in facts, fairness, and policy - not personal preference.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h4><strong>Confidence: Stepping Forward With Purpose</strong></h4>
<p>Confidence is the difference between being in the room and having a voice in the room. It’s not about being loud; it’s about being grounded - willing to speak up, challenge constructively, and advocate for what matters.</p>
<p>Consider a meeting where learning budgets are on the chopping block. A confident HR leader comes prepared - with data, insight, and an understanding of how development connects to retention and performance. Confidence gives HR the presence to influence - not just observe.</p>
<h4><strong>Why It All Matters</strong></h4>
<p>When HR professionals bring capability, competence, and confidence into their work, they build credibility with leaders, strengthen trust with employees, and help shape smarter, more sustainable organizations.</p>
<p>This isn’t about perfection. It’s about direction. Each element of the trifecta builds over time - through learning, experience, and intentional practice. HR professionals who invest in this growth don’t just elevate their role; they elevate their organization.</p>{{ include_custom_fonts({""Elza"":[""Bold"",""Bold Italic"",""Light"",""Light Italic"",""Medium"",""Medium Italic"",""Regular"",""Regular Italic"",""Semi Bold"",""Semi Bold Italic""],""Marion"":[""Bold"",""Regular"",""Regular Italic""]}) }}","https://cdn.humareso.com/hubfs/Humareso%20Blog%20Posts-1-The%20HR%20Trifecta%20%281%29.jpeg","","PUBLISHED","false"

<p>Seasoned HR professionals are very fond of telling new HR grads or HR pros in the early stages of their careers a line that has become a tired cliché that is so hard-to-hear. What is it? <em>“If you like people, don’t get into HR.”</em> (and then they add the disclaimer of “I’m joking…not really…”).</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Trust me…I totally understand self-deprecating humor, but folks who do this tend to be moving beyond self-deprecation and into self-defeating territory. It drives me mad.</p>
<p>And makes me sad.</p>
<p>If this “joke” becomes one’s mantra, it’s someone who is missing the whole point of human resources. In my estimation, “liking” people isn’t just a nice–to–have…it’s essential. Because at its core, HR isn’t about policies or pushing paperwork; it’s about understanding, connecting with, and supporting <em>people</em>. The <strong><em>people</em></strong> who are integral to the success of the business!</p>
<p>But in today’s hyper-digital world, where AI is automating everything from resume screening to performance reviews, there’s a real risk that we forget <strong>why</strong> HR exists in the first place: to champion the human side of work.</p>
<p>So, how do we keep people at the heart of our HR strategy while simultaneously leveraging current (and emerging!) technology? I have some thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Debunk the “Wrong Reasons” Myth</strong></p>
<p>First things first: If anyone tells you that liking people is a bad reason to be in HR, feel free to raise an eyebrow (or two) and then educate them. HR isn’t just about compliance checklists or navigating labor laws (though those are critical too). It is, however, about fostering environments where people can thrive, where their motivations and talents are recognized, and where empathy isn’t seen as a weakness … but as a leadership superpower.</p>
<p>If you don’t like people - or at the very minimum don’t care about helping them succeed - you’re going to struggle in HR. Why? Because emotional intelligence, understanding human behavior, and building strong relationships are what differentiate a strategic HR leader from someone who just cites policies and checks things off a list.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Strike the Right Balance: Data-Driven, Human-Led</strong></p>
<p>Yes, technology gives us incredible tools. Data dashboards, predictive analytics, and AI-driven insights help us identify trends and make more informed decisions. But data without <em>context</em>? That’s just noise.</p>
<p>Numbers can tell you <em>what’s</em> happening - turnover rates, absenteeism, engagement scores - but they don’t explain the <em>why</em>. That’s where creativity and human insight come in and HR leaders need to blend cold, hard facts with intuition and experience to craft solutions that are as thoughtful as they are strategic.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Acknowledge that AI Is Smart, But People Are Smarter (most of the time)</strong></p>
<p>AI is fantastic at processing large volumes of data and spotting patterns faster than any human could. But let’s not get totally carried away - AI lacks nuance, empathy, and ethics. It doesn’t understand the <em>subtleties</em> of workplace dynamics or the human factors that influence decision-making.</p>
<p>In short? You can teach an algorithm to detect red flags in an employee’s performance data, but only a human can understand if that dip is due to burnout, personal struggles, or a toxic manager. Technology should <em>support</em> your decision-making process, not replace it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Design People-First HR Strategies (enhanced by tech)</strong></p>
<p>The sweet spot for modern HR lies in using technology to enhance - not replace - our human instincts.</p>
<ul style=""font-size: 22px;"">
<li><span style=""font-family: Marion; font-weight: 400;"">Automate the transactional and humanize the transformational. Use tech to handle repetitive tasks so HR professionals can focus on meaningful conversations and strategy.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: Marion;"">Let data inform decisions … not dictate them. Numbers should be a guide, but context and creativity should lead the way.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: Marion;"">Prioritize ethics and empathy. As you implement new technologies, always ask: How does this impact our people?</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: Marion;"">Keep listening. No matter how advanced the tools or technology become, regular, honest human conversations are still the best way to understand your workforce.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Human Touch Will Always Matter</strong></p>
<p>Technology will continue to evolve, and HR professionals will need to adapt. But here’s the truth: No algorithm will ever replace a genuine conversation, a thoughtful mentor, or a leader who understands what makes their people tick.</p>
<p>So yes, if you got into HR because you <em>like people</em>, congratulations - you’re exactly where you should be. Just don’t forget to bring your curiosity, strategic thinking, and (let’s be honest) a healthy dose of sarcasm along for the ride.</p>
<p>Because in the age of AI, the most powerful tool in HR will always be… <em>you</em>.</p>{{ include_custom_fonts({""Elza"":[""Bold"",""Bold Italic"",""Light"",""Light Italic"",""Medium"",""Medium Italic"",""Regular"",""Regular Italic"",""Semi Bold"",""Semi Bold Italic""],""Marion"":[""Bold"",""Regular"",""Regular Italic""]}) }}","https://cdn.humareso.com/hubfs/Untitled%20%282%29.png","","PUBLISHED","false"

<p>The difficulty of being a curmudgeon is deep and wide. As a rapidly-becoming older person, the temptation to slide into the glass being perpetually half-empty becomes more appealing. “Nothing” will ever be as good as it once was, and it is my job to highlight those failures through an unwelcome twelve-point treatise. Now while I don’t actually do this (please God, don’t have me do this!), I am struck by how many do. We look back on what once was with rose-colored glasses, focusing solely on how good life once was (lies, all lies).</p>
<!--more--><p>I don’t think the intention is to become this. I also know that this is not an exclusive problem to the older generations. Recently, I heard a twenty-something share all the reasons why work sucks, people suck and how if everyone would just see things the way they did, then everything would work out much better for <a href=""https://blog.humareso.com/creep"">everyone</a>. They were “current” and had their finger on the pulse of what everyone their age wants. Really? Have we really allowed the training wheels to come off the proverbial bike with this level of frustration and ineptitude? We cannot really believe we will make true progress through such a negative, inflexible, unapproachable demeanor.</p>
<p>And lest you think that negativity stymies collaboration and innovation leading to high performing cultures, it <a href=""https://blog.humareso.com/photograph"">does not</a> on its own. It is the entrenched stubbornness that pulls us under. Sometimes negative points of view challenge our approach and we need to take those perspectives into consideration. But inflexible stoicism about the negative truths is unhelpful. We won’t be able to advance our organizations through robust market penetration and creative problem solving with those stubborn curmudgeons blocking the way.</p>
<p>If you’ve slipped into such a dynamic or are living through it in your workplace, here are a few ways to address it:</p>
<p><strong>Decide you are fallible</strong> – The tension we experience is oft-based upon our self-righteous conviction of infallible information. We know what we know and that is all there is to know. This belief exists in companies even though we say things like “innovation and advancement provide daily learning opportunities.” We don’t really believe it and we don’t act like we believe it. Listen, you don’t know everything. Say that out loud to yourself. Be free from the misdirected burden that you must be correct in every way. Put effort into understanding rather than posturing. In this way, when there is a truth to share, you would be seen as a contributor to success, even when the offering is a negative view of an issue.</p>
<p><strong>Rally the core</strong> – Who can you be vulnerable with by asking for their view of your inputs? And if you have a compadre who thinks like you, then look for another person. Find a trusted resource who would be honest. And if you have made the environment unsafe because of your negativity, then start by owning that. Ask for forgiveness and then ask for their insight. Let the person know you are seeking to know and that you are endeavoring to change. It is not a guarantee that this person will jump right in to share, so it may take a bit of time before they share as you need them to.</p>
<p><strong>Practice being winsome and positive</strong> – When you have operated in “curmudgeonness” for a while, your sensors need retraining. They need to be willfully redirected towards engaged relationship building and collaborative advancement. This is not the same as becoming “Susie Sunshine” but rather one who is welcome to participate in group meetings, developmental conversations, and enthusiastic business forecasting. The Oscar the Grouch vibe won’t get you there. Learning how to (re)function in a productive manner that is inclusive of all takes training. If you know someone who could help you reframe, ask them for help here as well.</p>
<p>Today is a great day to stop sitting in your office spouting negativity. It is a great day to change your frowning face and your down-on-the-world mentality. Today is a great day to get up and choose to engage openly and productively and be welcomed to do so. Being a curmudgeon doesn’t look good on anyone; stop trying to bring it into fashion.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you seen that hilarious commercial for the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvYvqO6gPCo"">Aunts</a>? Geico has put out some incredible commercials through the years, and this one is no exception. The concept of uninvited houseguests who also happen to be aunts of the homeowners is an approachable setup for the viewer. You may likely have an aunt like that. She comes into the home and comments on everything; it’s like a wicked game for these aunts. Our feelings of inadequacy rise to the surface. Ah, good times. To tap into such emotions, albeit tension and toxicity, brings a shared experience to life. That is the mark of a great commercial. Even though it’s been four years since its initial release, the commercial is still being played currently.</p>
<p>The shared experience of that commercial is fine when it’s at a distance. If we were really living that experience, however, the response would be much different. The annoyance of people pointing out your flaws and missteps would drive you out the door or to commit a felony. In the day-to-day, people in organizations tend to experience this type of interaction in a slow and steady manner. Chipping away at our self-esteem, we may sit despondent hoping that another interaction with colleagues wouldn’t be for another six months.</p>
<p>This cannot be the truth that we allow people to live in.</p>
<p>Fortitude is a great durable skill. Through encounters like these, our employees can learn how to become grounded, to filter out unnecessary distractions and to perform at the level the organization needs. But this is not an excuse for a poor work environment. The competency building needs not to be done on the backs of trauma and toxicity. In other words, the ends do not justify the means.</p>
<p>How else can we build fortitude in our staff? Firstly, expect the challenges and failures to come. Sounds simple, right? However, we don’t usually include in our onboarding protocols expectation management around failure. Work failure is a very real part of the experience at your organization, especially if it is promoting creativity, innovation and change.</p>
<p>By setting the tone for challenges to come, we promote <a href=""https://blog.humareso.com/everybody-hurts"">coping</a> mechanism development. How can an employee best train themselves in managing stress and in maintaining a forward-thinking perspective? We can provide resources in mindfulness, in relaxation, in mental acuity and toughness. All these areas can lead to a healthy development of fortitude in our staff.</p>
<p>It’s much easier to build support structures and cultivate adaptability when someone has invested internally in the hard work of fortitude development. Too often, organizations throw mentoring and resource groups at staff without providing a way for the individual to first invest in self. Those structures are difficult to maintain when the foundation is not there, or maybe even worse, if the “aunts” have been allowed to build their foundations.</p>
<p>Today is a great day to remove those Auntie Influencers; they are the ones who are now “expired!”</p>

<p>All throughout their childhoods, there were marked opportunities for greatness and future renown. Now, I know that every parent thinks this, but they’re wrong. My kids were the best (says every parent). My son was destined for MLB, my eldest daughter was going to be the next Matisse, and my youngest daughter was Broadway-bound. Look, I had great expectations.</p>
<p><!--more-->When Cass, my youngest, was cast as one of the Cell Block girls in the musical Chicago (yes, a high school production), I knew that my dreams were underway. And when she belted those numbers while doing the inverted spread eagle on a chair, I thought, here we go! Alas, she had other plans for her future (Selfish!).</p>
<p>But there was this young man in the role of Amos Hart singing “Mr. Cellophane” who poured himself into that singular star-power moment from the show. His unassuming demeanor resonated with the lyrics he sang. I believed that everyone could look right through him and walk right by him, as the song goes. He owned the role.</p>
<p>Too often, we have people in our organizations who have similar roles. They are easily <a href=""https://blog.humareso.com/we-are-the-champions"">overlooked</a> without a word spoken in protest. We count on their quiet fortitude and non-complaining demeanor. We say they are just grateful for the work and don’t want to rock the boat. And while that may be true for some, we honestly have no idea…that is, until they resign.</p>
<p>The shock and the betrayal we feel. How could they do this to us? Why would they do this to us? They were such good workers, and we told them every so often, maybe. That seemed to be enough, right? I mean, our attention is normally given to the loud mouths and troublemakers, so we don’t really have time to coddle everyone, especially the quiet ones. The ones that you chose not to engage or recognize.</p>
<p>Don’t let Mr. Cellophane fool you. He’s a hard worker. He shows up on time and is consistent in his work. He is dependable as the day is long. He is Joe, Melanie, Diego and Shawna. He is every employee whose name you are struggling to recall. You know that person who’s been here for five years? Yes, that one.</p>
<p>We need those people. That is not to say, however, that the right response to those coming to mind is to promote them to management. Stop with the singular career ladder. Not every person, in some ways especially a Mr. Cellophane, wants to manage others. There are alternative career ladders that can be activated. We forget this sometimes.</p>
<p>Deepen your interest in those who have made an investment of consistency and “meets expectations” through the years. They have a place within our organizations, and we ought to recognize them. Check in with those who don’t lobby for your time. Encourage coaching conversations focused on process improvement and innovation. Ask specific questions; open-ended questions might foster quick one-word answers from Mr. Cellophane. Seek to know and to understand.</p>
<p>Perhaps the worst thing that an employee could share about their experience is from the song itself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style=""text-align: left; padding-left: 0.5in;"">""A human being's made of more than air</p>
<p style=""text-align: left; padding-left: 0.5in;"">With all that bulk, you're bound to see him there</p>
<p style=""text-align: left; padding-left: 0.5in;"">Unless that human being next to you</p>
<p style=""text-align: left; padding-left: 0.5in;"">Is unimpressive, undistinguished, you know who.""</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s not wait for the resignation for us to pay attention to the reliable workers in our companies. Don’t walk by another employee that you haven’t checked in with in months, years, ever.</p>{{ include_custom_fonts({""Elza"":[""Bold"",""Bold Italic"",""Light"",""Light Italic"",""Medium"",""Medium Italic"",""Regular"",""Regular Italic"",""Semi Bold"",""Semi Bold Italic""],""Marion"":[""Bold"",""Regular"",""Regular Italic""]}) }}","https://cdn.humareso.com/hubfs/Humareso%20Blog%20Posts-1-Mr.%20Cellophane.png","","PUBLISHED","false"

Drawing on 27 years of marriage, this blog highlights the parallels between personal and professional expectation management, offering insights on fostering clarity, confidence, and collaboration.","2025-01-28 17:45:00","2025-01-28T17:45:00.669Z","<p>Marriage is one of the best examples of expectation management. As someone who has traveled this road for almost 27 years, I have messed up and fallen short of that expectation management often (shocking, right?). I thought she would know something I needed or wanted automatically. Guess what? She did not. And I didn’t know hers either. That’s part of the fun of figuring this <a href=""https://blog.humareso.com/dont-dream-its-over"">out</a>. However, it doesn’t always feel like fun. It can be tense, hurtful, and annoying.</p>
<!--more--><p>At work, it’s the same. We overlook how a lack of clear work expectations can lead to frustration, disengagement, and missed opportunities. It is part of our responsibility to ensure that our teams understand not only what’s expected of them but why it matters. Clarity is not a luxury; it’s a necessity!</p>
<p>We need to address ambiguity. Ambiguity leads to uncertainty, and uncertainty is a breeding ground for stress. Employees who aren’t sure what’s expected of them often end up second-guessing their work. We don’t need to facilitate lower confidence and poor productivity with our staff.</p>
<p>And we know how much unnecessary conflict arises when team members have differing interpretations of their roles. Managers struggle to communicate expectations and wind up defaulting to presumptions – “They should know how to do their job.” They may know how to do their job, but they may not know how the organization wants it done.</p>
<p>When expectations are vague, employees may also inadvertently focus their efforts on tasks that aren’t aligned with organizational goals. This misalignment doesn’t just impact individual performance - it affects the team and the company’s bottom line. Clear expectations eliminate this ambiguity. Sit and talk to your staff. Share what is needed for success.</p>
<p>And lest you think once is enough, outlining clear expectations doesn’t end with a one-time conversation. <a href=""https://humareso.com/rhabit"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Feedback</a> is the bridge between expectations and outcomes. Employees need to know how they’re doing and where they stand. Constructive feedback helps reinforce clarity by highlighting what’s working and addressing areas for improvement.</p>
<p>Feedback isn’t just a top-down exercise, either. Encourage employees to ask questions and provide input. Their perspectives can help identify areas where expectations might still be unclear. Collaborative conversations create a culture of mutual respect and shared responsibility for success. It’s a two-way street!</p>
<p>When employees have clarity, they gain confidence. Bottom line. They’re empowered to make decisions, take initiative, and innovate within their roles. This autonomy doesn’t just boost morale; it drives better results. Teams with clear expectations operate more efficiently, adapt more quickly to change, and deliver higher-quality work.</p>
<p>Just as I needed my wife to explain her needs and expectations, more than once, so do our staff and teams. Keep the cadence reasonable and your observations astute.</p>{{ include_custom_fonts({""Elza"":[""Bold"",""Bold Italic"",""Light"",""Light Italic"",""Medium"",""Medium Italic"",""Regular"",""Regular Italic"",""Semi Bold"",""Semi Bold Italic""],""Marion"":[""Bold"",""Regular"",""Regular Italic""]}) }}","https://cdn.humareso.com/hubfs/Humareso%20Blog%20Posts-1-What%20You%20Dont%20Know%20-%20Expectation%20Management%20and%20H.png","","PUBLISHED","false"

Learn how to align skills with your company’s goals.","2024-12-18 17:35:31","2024-12-18T17:35:31.358Z","<p><img src=""https://cdn.humareso.com/hubfs/Humareso%20Blog%20Posts-1-BuildMeUpButtercup.jpeg"" width=""2400"" height=""1280"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Humareso Blog Posts-1-BuildMeUpButtercup"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 2400px;""></p>
<p>A favorite TV show of mine, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alias_(TV_series)""><strong>Alias</strong></a>, focused on Sydney Bristow (played by Jennifer Garner – love, love, love her). She is a spy extraordinaire. Each episode saw her use those spy skills across the globe ruining various terrorist and extremist plans. To be sure, she was not just thrown into those missions without preparation. Besides a very helpful team, she was constantly developing her competencies— mastering new languages, learning advanced tech skills, adapting to high-stakes environments and more. Her ability to navigate complex situations, many times happening on the fly, stems from deliberate, ongoing skill development.</p>
<!--more--><p>And while we may not have spies in our organizations (I left the door wide open for comments on that!) our employees still need tailored opportunities to grow and succeed in their roles. Organizational development isn’t just a box to check; it’s the backbone of sustainable growth and adaptability.</p>
<p>Why does competency development matter so much in talent management? For starters, it equips employees to meet the challenges of a rapidly shifting business environment. Technology is advancing at a breakneck pace, customer expectations are shifting, and industries are becoming increasingly interconnected. Without the right competencies, even the most motivated employees can find themselves struggling to keep up. Investing in these areas ensures not only that employees can perform their current roles effectively but also that they’re prepared for what’s next. Isn’t that what we often are asking for – opportunities to build the future?</p>
<p>One of the key benefits of focusing on competencies is the alignment it brings across the organization. When clear expectations are set regarding what “competence” looks like for each role, it fosters a shared understanding among teams and departments. Employees know what’s expected of them, managers can better guide their teams, and leadership has a clear roadmap for organizational development. This alignment creates a cohesive culture where everyone is moving toward common goals.</p>
<p>Further still, competency development is a catalyst for employee engagement and retention. Today’s workforce craves growth opportunities (yes, I know, some want promotions daily…), but often employees just want to feel that they’re making a difference while advancing in their careers. By offering targeted learning and development programs, organizations signal to their employees that they are valued. This builds loyalty, reduces turnover, and ultimately saves the company significant recruitment and training costs.</p>
<p>We also need to be advocates of fostering innovation. By investing in and equipping staff with diverse skill sets and the confidence to use them, they’re more likely to think creatively and propose innovative solutions. What if we had an employee population that didn’t just execute strategies, but also contributed to shaping them. This is particularly important in industries that are experiencing disruption or are on the cusp of transformation. Companies that prioritize such competency development are better positioned to lead rather than follow.</p>
<p>It’s not enough to offer generic training programs or rely on annual performance reviews to identify gaps. It begins with defining the core competencies needed at every level of the organization—from entry-level positions to leadership roles. These competencies should be aligned with the company’s mission, vision, and values, as well as its long-term goals. It is likely that an organization will need to leverage tools such as skills assessments, personalized development plans, and continuous feedback mechanisms to determine some of these competencies as well as then track developmental progress. Use technology as a tool here, not as a substitute for creating a culture of learning. Listen to the marketplace. Keep an eye on process advancement. Ask employees what they see. Pick the brains of management and executive leadership. There are many resources already at the ready.</p>
<p>While it may be the most exciting to build competencies for CIA operatives like Sydney Bristow, each employee within our care should have the opportunity to grow and develop. Perhaps you would like to show off the high kick to the face method from <strong>Alias</strong>, but that skill development might just get you sued. Stick to those competencies that really matter for success in the role.</p>

  <p>The manufacturing sector is standing at a crossroads, shaped by rapid technological advancements, shifting employee expectations, and increasing global competition. Workforce challenges like retention, talent attraction, upskilling, and engagement aren’t just HR concerns, they’re critical business imperatives. To stay competitive, manufacturers must evolve their workforce strategies to address these pressing issues.</p>
  <p>At Rhabit Analytics, we specialize in helping organizations transform their workforce through innovative tools for <strong>employee engagement</strong>, <strong>leadership development</strong>, and <strong>performance management</strong>. These solutions empower manufacturers to adapt to today’s challenges and build a stronger, more agile workforce for the future. Here are the five workforce trends shaping 2025, and how Rhabit Analytics can help manufacturers thrive.</p>
  <h3><strong>1. Retaining Top Talent Is More Crucial Than Ever</strong></h3>
  <p>Turnover remains one of the most costly challenges for manufacturers. Whether it’s seasoned operators or newly trained recruits, losing employees disrupts operations, increases training costs, and puts additional strain on remaining staff. Studies show that disengaged employees are more likely to leave, making retention a multifaceted challenge.</p>
  <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong><br>Retention isn’t just about reducing churn, it’s about maintaining institutional knowledge, improving productivity, and sustaining team morale. Employees want to feel that their voices are heard and that their contributions are valued.</p>
  <p><strong>How Rhabit Helps:</strong><br>Rhabit’s <strong>employee engagement platform</strong> gathers continuous, real-time feedback from your workforce. This gives leaders actionable insights into what employees care about most, helping you address issues before they escalate. By fostering a culture of listening and responsiveness, manufacturers can reduce turnover and cultivate a workplace where employees feel valued and supported.</p>
  <h3><strong>2. The Talent War in Manufacturing Is Intensifying</strong></h3>
  <p>As demand for skilled labor grows, manufacturers are competing not only within their industry but also with sectors offering remote work and flexible schedules. Today’s workforce(particularly younger generations) prioritizes companies with strong leadership, opportunities for career development, and a positive workplace culture.</p>
  <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong><br>Attracting the best talent is critical to maintaining operational excellence. Manufacturers must differentiate themselves by offering more than just competitive pay. Candidates are looking for companies that demonstrate commitment to their employees’ growth and well-being.</p>
  <p><strong>How Rhabit Helps:</strong><br>Our <strong>leadership development tools</strong> equip managers with the skills to build high-performing, inclusive teams. Managers trained through Rhabit are better equipped to foster positive work environments that attract and retain top talent. By developing leaders who inspire trust and growth, manufacturers can position themselves as employers of choice in a crowded talent market.</p>
  <h3><strong>3. Upskilling Is Key to Embracing Industry 4.0</strong></h3>
  <p>Automation, robotics, and AI are reshaping manufacturing. While these technologies promise to boost productivity, they also require employees to develop new technical and problem-solving skills. Upskilling isn’t just a competitive advantage; it’s essential for survival in an industry undergoing constant transformation.</p>
  <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong><br>Manufacturers that invest in their workforce’s development gain the flexibility to adapt to technological changes and seize new opportunities. Without upskilling, companies risk falling behind their competitors and losing key talent to industries that prioritize employee growth.</p>
  <p><strong>How Rhabit Helps:</strong><br>Rhabit’s <strong>performance management solution</strong> provides the data manufacturers need to identify skill gaps and track progress on employee development initiatives. With customizable goal-setting and progress tracking, you can align training programs with your workforce’s specific needs and ensure measurable results.</p>
  <h3><strong>4. Employee Engagement Drives Productivity and Safety</strong></h3>
  <p>Disengaged employees cost U.S. companies billions annually in lost productivity, absenteeism, and turnover. In manufacturing, disengagement can also lead to operational errors, missed deadlines, and safety incidents. Engaging your workforce is not just about improving morale; it directly impacts business outcomes.</p>
  <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong><br>Engaged employees are more productive, collaborative, and committed to their work. They’re also more likely to contribute to a positive workplace culture, which has a ripple effect across teams and departments.</p>
  <p><strong>How Rhabit Helps:</strong><br>Our <strong>employee engagement platform</strong> enables continuous feedback loops, ensuring employees feel heard while providing leaders with actionable data. Rhabit’s user-friendly tools help you measure engagement levels, identify problem areas, and implement targeted strategies to foster a collaborative, high-performing workforce.</p>
  <h3><strong>5. Managers Must Lead with Agility and Empathy</strong></h3>
  <p>The demands on managers in manufacturing are evolving. Beyond overseeing daily operations, managers are now expected to mentor, motivate, and navigate change. Ineffective management can erode team morale, hinder productivity, and increase turnover, making manager development a top priority.</p>
  <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong><br>Effective managers directly impact employee satisfaction and performance. Investing in leadership development not only improves team dynamics but also boosts overall business outcomes.</p>
  <p><strong>How Rhabit Helps:</strong><br>Rhabit’s <strong>leadership development platform</strong> provides managers with data-driven insights into their performance, allowing them to refine their communication, coaching, and decision-making skills. By fostering better leadership behaviors, Rhabit ensures managers can inspire their teams to excel even in challenging times.</p>
  <h3><strong>Preparing for 2025: The Rhabit Advantage</strong></h3>
  <p>The manufacturing workforce is at a turning point, and the decisions made today will determine tomorrow’s success. Addressing workforce challenges like retention, talent attraction, upskilling, engagement, and manager effectiveness requires more than ad-hoc solutions—it demands a strategic, data-driven approach.</p>
  <p>Rhabit Analytics is here to help manufacturers transform their workforce strategy. With powerful tools for employee engagement, leadership development, and performance management, we empower manufacturers to:</p>
  <ul role=""list"">
   <li><strong>Retain top talent</strong> by fostering a culture of appreciation and responsiveness.</li>
   <li><strong>Attract skilled employees</strong> by cultivating strong leadership and positive workplace environments.</li>
   <li><strong>Upskill teams</strong> to prepare for the demands of Industry 4.0.</li>
   <li><strong>Boost engagement</strong> to enhance productivity, safety, and collaboration.</li>
   <li><strong>Develop managers</strong> into agile, empathetic leaders who inspire their teams to perform at their best.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Build a Thriving Workforce for the Future</strong><br>The challenges facing the manufacturing industry in 2025 are significant, but they are also opportunities for innovation and growth.

<p>Think about how many times you write “thank you” or “thanks” to end an email. Maybe your signature is automated to include this without any thought on your part. “Thanks” seems like the right thing to do. We have become conditioned more from a mannerly perspective to offer a thank you rather than out of true considerate gratitude. I mean, are we really saying thank you to the person who wrote you a nasty email? Are we really saying thank you to our manager who chewed us out for something that wasn’t our fault? Well, your email says you’re thankful.</p>
<!--more--><p>Truth be told, the discipline of gratitude is a healthy one. For the last 15 years or so, researchers have studied the effects of gratitude with consistency. Annual surveys are produced and shared; articles detailing the brain’s receptivity to appreciation have been written. The market has opened up for an intentional approach to gratitude with developed software platforms for integrated employee experience. Engagement surveys have broadened the areas of appreciation to be measured. The commitment to its impact does not look like it will be waning anytime soon.</p>
<p>In <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113862/""><strong>Mr. Holland’s Opus</strong></a>, Glenn Holland (Richard Dreyfuss) struggles through raising a deaf son, battling a school district’s approach to music education and his own demons of inadequacy. It’s an Academy Award nominated performance for Dreyfuss, and rightly so. Without giving away too much if you’ve not seen it, the end of the movie provides consideration for Mr. Holland’s contributions to education as well as in the lives of his students over his 30-year career. Grab a tissue and get ready for an appreciation overload.</p>
<p>So how does gratitude work in a company where there has been limited desire to be thankful beyond an annual bonus or a company-wide email at Thanksgiving? First, do the research yourself. Read the various articles and research project outlines dealing with the physical benefits of appreciation. Our brains respond chemically to <a href=""https://blog.humareso.com/the-story-of-my-life"">gratitude</a>; we like it. Consider areas of well-being and safety in the workplace. In these areas, gratitude reduces stress and opens a door wider for transparent and authentic dialogue from employees to their managers, HR or leadership team. The impact is provable, and the research affirms consistency in the results.</p>
<p>Secondly, do not minimize what has been done to date. If an annual email is the only thing to really point to, then lean into it. A company may be looking to expand its intentional commitment to gratitude, but it does not need to belittle what was done to date. If so, for those for whom the annual email is affirmational, the company makes that gesture seem inauthentic and, therefore, a lie to the employee. That is not what you mean to say. Build upon what is already in place, however small it may be.</p>
<p>Next, start incrementally. There may be a variety of good ideas offered, but it would be unwise to activate all of them. Issues of resources and stamina are not to be minimized. What will it take for the company to really get behind all the ideas offered? Likely more than the company can commit to. That’s okay. Adding two things to one thing is a 200% increase. That is significant. Be committed to those one or two additions with thoughtful launch plans – testing, access, messaging, feedback. Follow a change management process; no really, follow one. Commit to it.</p>
<p>And finally, celebrate the celebrating. Change the tone of gratitude being a nice thing or even of it being a duty into one of elation. Celebrating people is meaningful. It is a call to affirm individuals; we should encourage managers to be personable about it. Be kind and generous in expression. Truly cheer on one another.</p>
<p>What can you do today to start an attitude of gratitude or expand upon the appreciation commitment in place? Thankfulness is worth the investment.</p>

  <h2>The Evolution of Employee Engagement</h2>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>Employee engagement has undergone a significant transformation in recent years. No longer confined to annual surveys or sporadic initiatives, engagement is now recognized as an ongoing, dynamic process essential to long-term organizational success. Modern workplaces must shift their focus from one-off events to a continuous, meaningful engagement strategy that adapts to the evolving needs of the workforce. In today’s competitive business environment, building a sustainable employee engagement program is not just beneficial – it's critical for fostering productivity, employee retention, and a thriving company culture.</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <h2>Why Continuous Employee Engagement Matters</h2>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p><a href=""/employee-engagement"">Employee engagement</a> is far more than a checklist item or a temporary project. A truly engaged workforce is empowered, motivated, and aligned with an organization’s core values and objectives. When engagement is sustained over time, it has a profound impact on key business outcomes, including:</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>1. <strong>Boosted Productivity</strong>: Engaged employees are more productive, motivated, and committed to their work. They are more likely to go the extra mile, take ownership of their responsibilities, and contribute innovative ideas.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>2. <strong>Enhanced Retention:</strong> Employees who feel connected to their roles and the organization are less likely to leave. A strong sense of purpose and belonging significantly lowers turnover rates and helps build long-term employee loyalty.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>3. <strong>Improved Customer Satisfaction:</strong> There’s a clear link between employee engagement and customer satisfaction. Engaged employees provide better service, are more enthusiastic about their work, and are better at building relationships with customers.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>4. <strong>Stronger Company Culture:</strong> A culture of engagement fosters trust, collaboration, and mutual respect. It creates a positive work environment where employees feel valued and supported, leading to better teamwork, higher morale, and a shared commitment to company success.</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <h2>Psychological Safety: The Bedrock of Employee Engagement</h2>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>At the heart of a truly engaged workforce is psychological safety. This concept, popularized by Harvard Business School professor Amy Edmondson, refers to the belief that one will not be humiliated or penalized for speaking up with ideas, questions, concerns, or mistakes. When employees feel safe to take risks and share their authentic selves, they are more likely to contribute meaningfully to the organization and engage in problem-solving.</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>To foster psychological safety, organizations should implement the following strategies:</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>- <strong>Encourage Open Communication:</strong> Create accessible channels for employees to share their thoughts and feedback, such as suggestion boxes, town hall meetings, and anonymous surveys.</p>
  <p>- <strong>Model Vulnerability:</strong> Leaders must lead by example. By acknowledging their own mistakes and uncertainties, leaders can build trust and inspire their teams to do the same.</p>
  <p>- <strong>Recognize and Reward Contributions:</strong> Acknowledge both individual and team achievements. Recognizing small successes, whether through informal praise or formal rewards, strengthens employees’ connection to the organization.</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <h2>A Phased Approach to Building a Continuous Engagement Program</h2>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>Implementing an employee engagement program should be a phased process to ensure its success and sustainability. A gradual approach allows organizations to test strategies, assess effectiveness, and scale up efforts over time.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>At Rhabit, we take a phased approach to rolling out our employee engagement software into workforces:</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>1. 
   <!-- -->Begin with a pilot program that focuses on a small group or specific team. This could include a pulse survey to measure employee sentiment or a pilot team-building initiative. Gather feedback to understand what’s working and what needs improvement. This phase is about testing ideas, identifying potential challenges, and refining the approach.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>2. 
   <!-- -->Expand the program to include a broader range of employees, incorporating more activities and engagement tools. Introduce initiatives like regular one-on-one check-ins, peer recognition programs, or company-wide social events. At this stage, the program should be flexible, allowing employees to participate in ways that resonate with them.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>3. 
   <!-- -->Once the engagement strategy is solidified, scale it across the entire organization. This phase involves implementing comprehensive employee experience platforms, creating ongoing feedback loops, and prioritizing employee development and career growth. The focus should be on creating a consistent, continuous experience that aligns with the company's long-term objectives.</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <h2>The Role of Leadership in Employee Engagement</h2>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>Leadership is one of the most influential factors in the success of any engagement initiative. Engaged leaders inspire and motivate their teams, set the tone for organizational culture, and actively shape the employee experience. Effective leadership communication is key to building and sustaining employee engagement over time. To engage employees, leaders should:</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>- Be Transparent and Honest: Openly share the company’s vision, mission, and strategic objectives. Transparency about challenges and opportunities helps employees feel included in the organization’s journey and reinforces trust.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>- Listen Actively: Engage in regular conversations with employees, both formally and informally. Seek feedback through surveys, focus groups, and one-on-one meetings, and take action based on that input. Employees who feel heard are more likely to stay engaged and invested in their work.</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>- Share Results and Action Plans: Demonstrate accountability by sharing the outcomes of engagement initiatives and the specific actions being taken to address employee concerns. This transparency shows that leadership values employee feedback and is committed to continuous improvement.</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>- Celebrate Successes: Recognition is vital for maintaining engagement. Publicly acknowledge employee contributions, celebrate milestones, and highlight team achievements. Recognizing and rewarding effort not only boosts morale but also reinforces the behaviors that drive organizational success.</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <h2>Creating a Continuous Feedback Loop</h2>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>A critical component of a sustainable employee engagement program is a robust feedback loop. Continuous feedback—both from employees and managers—ensures that engagement efforts are aligned with employee needs and company goals. Regular feedback surveys, performance reviews, and team check-ins should be integrated into the company culture to keep engagement levels high and identify areas for improvement.</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>Tools such as employee engagement platforms, pulse surveys, and performance management systems can facilitate this ongoing feedback process. These tools allow managers to track employee sentiment, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions that optimize engagement strategies. Rhabit creates custom programs for organizations to streamline and centralize all of these processes with a simple easy to use platform.</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <h2>The Bottom Line: Employee Engagement is a Journey, Not a Destination</h2>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>Building and maintaining a sustainable employee engagement program is an ongoing journey, not a one-time event. It requires commitment from both leadership and employees, and it demands flexibility, transparency, and continuous adaptation to the needs of the workforce.</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>When organizations invest in building a culture of continuous engagement, they unlock the full potential of their teams. The result is a motivated, high-performing workforce that drives innovation, boosts retention and helps the organization thrive in a competitive marketplace.</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>By focusing on psychological safety, transparent leadership, continuous feedback, and phased implementation, organizations can create a lasting employee engagement program that fuels long-term success. The key to success lies in understanding that employee engagement is not a one-off project—it’s a continuous process that evolves with the organization’s goals and the needs of its people.</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>A well-executed employee engagement strategy is not just a perk for employees; it’s a strategic advantage for businesses. By taking a phased, thoughtful approach, fostering psychological safety, and creating transparent communication channels, companies can build sustainable engagement programs that drive productivity, improve employee retention, and contribute to a positive organizational culture. Continuous engagement is the key to unlocking your employees' potential and ensuring long-term organizational success.</p>

Joaquin Phoenix delivered a visually stunning, if not uncomfortably magnificent, performance in 2019’s <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7286456/?ref_=ttrt_ov""><strong>The Joker</strong></a>. He went on to win the Academy Award. His approach to a very well-known villain was fresh, psychologically complex, and disturbingly relatable. And so, what does Hollywood want to do? Capitalize on it with a sequel. Despite the fact that more times than not the <a href=""https://alexbass.me/posts/movie_sequels/#:~:text=Main%20Takeaway%3A%20More%20than%2060,the%20original%20outperforms%20the%20sequel."">original performs better</a>, we press into the popularity of the character(s) and provide a weak storyline hoping to just have people show up out of nostalgia. Think of <strong>Miss Congeniality 2</strong>, <strong>Legally Blonde 2</strong>, <strong>Ace Ventura 2</strong>, any <strong>Planet of the Apes</strong> and more.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The safety in sequels is that the perceived risk is low. The content is shallow, limiting the storyline’s advancement. We think that having Lady Gaga added to a sequel is pushing the envelope, but it’s really a safe risk. She’s a known entity. The stretch isn’t there because the goal isn’t good storytelling; it’s a level of revenue. If a sequel can pull in 70% of the original, it’s a success. Putting something completely new into the market doesn’t usually yield as high a return. There is safety in the risk, but there is not necessarily advancement in any other area.</p>
<p>Work is no different. We like the success of a new account executive. The wins that the person is experiencing in sales becomes a blueprint for what we now want others in the department to do. It’s formulaic, without a depth of understanding as to why it’s working. How many of those wins are, at least in part, due to the personality of the account executive? Are those intangibles of persona influencing such wins? How will that be replicated beyond mirroring?</p>
<p>For all the conversation we’ve had for the last ten years (at least!) regarding skill development and competency advancement, most research still points to the lack of skill advancement as being a direct influencer to an increase in unemployment by the end of <a href=""https://www.bankrate.com/banking/federal-reserve/economic-indicator-survey-jobs-april-2024/?tpt=b"">Q1 2025</a>. Could it be that we want the safe risk of repetition rather than truly developing skills? Likely so.</p>
<p>What’s the difference? Mimicking is not skill advancement. Development through instruction, practice, coaching, and redirection leads to skill advancement. A distinct plan for individual development is truly building competencies in a contributor. When Lady Gaga joined part two of <strong>The Joker</strong>, the miss is not in her, but rather in the content of the development of the storyline, her character and in the collaboration with the original characters. But what has been discussed is her (it’s not her!).</p>
<p>We are quick to blame, and very often, it is not the process that gets blamed but a person. Just a Lady Gaga became a target for what was wrong with the sequel (whether the lack of story, the lack of acting ability or the odd way she was used, it was Gaga-centric), we lose willing contributors for development when they see organizations devouring their own. It is not likely they will want that kind of heat. “No thanks” while not spoken is the effort offered. Effectively, why be part of the sequel?</p>
<p>Lest you think all sequels are bad, they are not. <strong>The Godfather, Part II</strong> serves as a masterpiece in cinema, a truly remarkable feat considering the original Godfather is epic. The development and deepening of characters and storyline pushed the actors involved to deliver in familiar yet enlarging ways. The value in the original was not merely about its commercial success but in the way it grounded a variety of actors in their craft. They were able to grow, express and evolve in that sequel.</p>
<p>The form is not the goal, but in the developmental, advancing function of multifaceted talent in an emerging story (market). When we merely work on form, we get <strong>The Godfather, Part III</strong>. And I don’t have enough time to talk about that monstrous disappointment…</p>

  <h1>Take Full Advantage of Your Professional Development Budget - Here's How</h1>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>One perk of working for an organization committed to professional development is a dedicated annual stipend for employees to use at their discretion to expand their learning opportunities. Unfortunately, this perk often goes overlooked as you may get too busy with your workload and external activities, and by the time the budget year ends, you’re scrambling to find a professional development activity to spend your stipend.</p>
  <p>There is a wide landscape of professional development activities to choose from, which can sometimes cause analysis paralysis and procrastination. From traditional coursework to specialized coaching, there's something to suit every learning style and career goal - so how can you best use your professional development budget in a way that will generate the results you’re looking for? Even better, will the program you select set you up for a raise, promotion, or next step in your career?</p>
  <h2>Here's a breakdown of some popular options and how they can help you make the most of your professional development budget:</h2>
  <h3><strong>1. Executive Coaching</strong></h3>
  <p>Executive coaching offers a personalized approach to professional development, providing one-on-one guidance from a seasoned professional. Coaches can help you identify your strengths and weaknesses, set goals, and develop strategies to achieve them. While executive coaching can be expensive, it can be a valuable investment for those seeking significant career advancement.</p>
  <p><strong>Key benefits of executive coaching:</strong></p>
  <ul role=""list"">
   <li>Tailored guidance and support</li>
   <li>Personalized development plans</li>
   <li>Increased self-awareness</li>
   <li>Improved leadership skills</li>
   <li>Enhanced decision-making abilities</li>
  </ul>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p><strong>Considerations:</strong> Executive coaching can be extremely cost-prohibitive and may not fit into an average PD budget. Going the coaching route may require a larger investment of time than your schedule allows, and once the program ends (or your budget runs out) you may not have anything tangible to share with your leader.</p>
  <h3><strong>2. Online Courses, LinkedIn Learning, and Coursera</strong></h3>
  <p>Online learning platforms like LinkedIn Learning and Coursera offer a wide range of courses on various topics, from technical skills to soft skills. These platforms provide flexibility and affordability, making them a popular choice for many professionals. </p>
  <p><strong>Key benefits of online learning platforms:</strong></p>
  <ul role=""list"">
   <li>Wide variety of courses</li>
   <li>Self-paced learning</li>
   <li>Affordable options</li>
   <li>Access to industry experts</li>
   <li>Convenient and flexible</li>
  </ul>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p><strong>Considerations:</strong> Online courses are great for flexibility and diversity of learning content, however, they may not adapt to your learning style, and you may not have the long-term results you would like to achieve.&nbsp;</p>
  <h3><strong>3. Credentialing Programs</strong></h3>
  <p>For those seeking to validate their skills and knowledge, credentialing programs can be a valuable investment. These programs often require completing coursework, passing exams, and meeting specific experience requirements. While credentialing programs can be time-consuming and expensive, they can significantly enhance your career prospects and earning potential.</p>
  <p><strong>Key benefits of credentialing programs:</strong></p>
  <ul role=""list"">
   <li>Recognized certifications like a PMP, SHRM or ATD certification, Lean, or other relevant certifications for your industry and career path.&nbsp;</li>
   <li>Increased earning potential</li>
   <li>Enhanced credibility</li>
   <li>Networking opportunities</li>
  </ul>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p><strong>Considerations:</strong> Gaining a certification is an excellent investment in your career and professional development, and often requires a significant time commitment and rigorous testing. If you are seeking a lighter-weight PD option, this may not be for you.</p>
  <h3><strong>4. Rhabit Reflect + Coaching</strong></h3>
  <p>Rhabit Reflect + Coaching offers a unique combination of leadership development, continuous feedback, and personalized coaching. This program provides a comprehensive approach to professional growth, helping you develop essential leadership skills, improve your self-awareness, and achieve your career goals.</p>
  <p><strong>Key benefits of Rhabit Reflect + Coaching:</strong></p>
  <ul role=""list"">
   <li><strong>Comprehensive leadership development:</strong> Access a vast library of leadership skills to grow and develop key leadership competencies like communication, innovation, coaching, and more.</li>
   <li><strong>Continuous feedback:</strong> Receive regular 360-degree feedback from your team, providing valuable insights into your strengths and areas for improvement.</li>
   <li><strong>Personalized coaching:</strong> Work one-on-one with a Rhabit coach to develop customized strategies and action plans tailored to your specific needs and goals.</li>
   <li><strong>Tangible outcomes:</strong> Receive a comprehensive report at the end of the program, highlighting your progress and accomplishments. Use this report to demonstrate your commitment to professional development during your performance reviews.</li>
   <li><strong>Flexible learning:</strong> Rhabit Reflect + Coaching offers a flexible learning format, allowing you to fit your professional development into your busy schedule.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Rhabit Reflect + Coaching is a cost-effective alternative to traditional executive coaching, providing many of the same benefits without the high price tag.</strong> When you choose Rhabit Reflect + Coaching for your professional development, you can unlock your full potential and drive your career forward.</p>
  <p><strong>Choosing the right option depends on your individual needs, goals, and budget.</strong> Consider the following factors when making your decision:</p>
  <ul role=""list"">
   <li><strong>Your career aspirations:</strong> What skills or knowledge do you need to advance in your career?</li>
   <li><strong>Your learning style:</strong> Do you prefer self-paced learning or personalized guidance?</li>
   <li><strong>Your budget:</strong> How much are you willing to invest in your professional development?</li>

  <h1>For Managers to Be Successful in 2025 They Must Focus on Developing These 5 Habits</h1>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>The past 5 years have put managers, both old and new, through a constant cycle of change, leaving many leaders burnt out and feeling overwhelmed. Managers may be struggling to pinpoint the habits they need to lead to personal and professional success. By understanding and addressing these opportunities for growth, managers can develop the skills and mindset needed to inspire and motivate their teams. In this article, we'll explore the top five leadership habits that leaders often struggle with and provide practical tips for improvement.</p>
  <h2>Leadership Habit 1: Learn to Delegate Like a Pro</h2>
  <p>This behavior has multiple variants and they all revolve around the idea of building a more skilled team through coaching.&nbsp;In many organizations, managers don’t coach and if they do, they don’t coach enough. This finding is tragic and frustrating at the same time.</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>The tragedy stems from the fact that managers have been operating at high level of burnout for years. This task-focused grind mentality prevents them from coaching their teams, which ironically is the best remedy for this problem. This is the vicious cycle of perpetual DIY: “We just got new project, my team cannot handle this, I have to do it myself, I don’t have time to teach them, my team will never learn”. At one point or another, every manager can relate to this statement.</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>Why do managers do this? Commonly this behavior has put them into a leadership position to begin with. They were very good at what they did, they outperformed their peers, but they never had to teach and distribute their skills. In most cases they have never been asked to delegate, only to perform.</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p><em>How do we break through the vicious cycle of perpetual DIY?</em></p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <h3>Here are three suggestions that can help managers to start delegating:</h3>
  <ol role=""list"">
   <li>Shadowing: When you take on your next project, let 1-2 employees shadow you. Let them document every step and review the documentation with them, revise if necessary. Let these employees take on the next similar project, and meet with them frequently in the beginning.&nbsp;</li>
   <li>Create a small task team. If you cannot carve out time to instruct your team, ask one or two employees to outline their best approach. Review this outline, enrich and fine-tune it. Then ask them to try it out in the wild.</li>
   <li>If you are truly overworked, it may be time to sacrifice your work outcomes for the benefit of training your team – <em>temporarily</em>. You only have to do this once to yield an immediate relief to your workload. Being perpetually overworked and overwhelmed is not sustainable. Now is the right time to drop old habits and build delegation skills.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>‍</p>
  <h2>Leadership Habit 2: Become a Master of Team Accountability</h2>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>Talking to your team about poor performance is probably the last thing on any manager's to-do list. No conversation is more awkward, uncomfortable, and unrewarding for both parties. And yet, <strong>no conversation is more important</strong>. Our <a href=""/build-a-performance-culture-leadership-behaviors"">research</a> shows that holding your team accountable is the single most important factor in retaining high performers. High performers don't like being on a team where their extra efforts aren't recognized.</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>Why are these conversations so hard? Most of us don’t feel comfortable bringing up low performance. Most people, and that includes managers, don’t like criticizing others. Every time we do that we put the relationship to the test. Even worse, if the conversation becomes confrontational, things get even more uncomfortable and difficult to navigate - especially for an inexperienced manager.</p>
  <h2><strong>‍</strong></h2>
  <blockquote>
   Rhabit Chief Science Officer, Alexander Schwall says:&nbsp;In our experience, holding teams accountable begins with setting clear expectations. Expectations that are defined and articulated 
   <em>ahead of time. </em>Any conversation about performance is made easier if performance expectations have been set.&nbsp;
  </blockquote>
  <h2><strong>‍</strong></h2>
  <p>The bad news, setting expectations takes a lot of time. It requires planning and looking ahead. The good news, when this is done collaboratively, allowing the employee to influence what expectations are set, this can be a motivating process.</p>
  <h2><strong>‍</strong></h2>
  <p>With these expectations in place, holding your team accountable is much easier. The conversation is not about whether or not expectations were met (this should be obvious). It is about what can be done better or what was done well. These problem-solving conversations can be had without deteriorating the relationship with your team.</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <h2>Leadership Habit 3: Be Willing To Fail</h2>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>When we try new approaches and apply them to our day to day we're actually experimenting. We experiment every time the outcomes are not known in advance. Without it, we are doomed to repeat the same actions over and over again and never try anything new. In an ever-changing environment trying new things is key to staying competitive.</p>
  <p><strong>‍</strong></p>
  <h3><strong>Why are managers reluctant or even afraid to experiment in their roles? </strong></h3>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>We believe managers feel pressured to hold up a facade of competence and independence while having to be the smartest person in the room. When subscribing to this mindset, experimenting may appear as not knowing the best solution. It may seem like admitting that we don’t know what to do to solve a problem.&nbsp;In addition, experiments may fail which is seen as weakness in the mind of an untrained leader. Leaders are taught, through observation, that failure is the worst possible outcome, when in reality the unwillingness to experiment can lead to tragic levels of professional stagnation.</p>
  <p><strong>‍</strong></p>
  <p>From our conversations with our clients' employees, we know that managers who try things out and run small and meaningful experiments come across as entirely different. They are seen for their willingness to take calculated risks, create cutting-edge solutions (that don’t have precedent), and can learn from their mistakes. If these experiments are run with input from capable employees there may be some extra credit in it for being a collaborative boss. That willingness to fail becomes a positive quality, inspiring others to take risks, which results in innovation.</p>
  <p><strong>‍</strong></p>
  <p>Experiments don’t have to be all-or-nothing bets. They can be small and focused tests of an idea. Try things out for a limited time, use free software trials, focus on small groups of clients to test something. We know some of our clients are very motivated to run little experiments with us.</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <h2>Leadership Habit 4: Encourage Bottom Up Feedback</h2>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>Feedback is hard, in and out of the workplace. Managers struggle with asking their peers and direct reports for feedback, and giving them the space for honest, objective feedback about their performance. In the minds of many managers, asking for feedback is equal to admitting fault or acknowledging weakness. Some managers may thing, ""If I have to ask you for feedback I am implicitly admitting that I am not capable of figuring out what I am doing wrong myself? If I am asking a direct report, others might even start to wonder if that employee should have my job to begin with?"".</p>
  <p><strong>‍</strong></p>
  <p>However, this is not the impression a manager leaves with their team when they ask for feedback. Asking for feedback on how to improve does not reveal a weakness. It shows strength and signals that we are curious about how to improve. </p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <h3>When asking for feedback, a manager demonstrates the following: </h3>
  <p>First, I am humble enough to know I don’t know everything, and humility is a quality that makes me relatable to others.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Second, I value their opinion and expertise. I admit that I cannot know everything and I acknowledge my team members as an expert.</p>
  <p>Third, getting things right is bigger than me. I don’t need to protect my ego. Improving the way we do things is more critical than presenting myself as an infallible, omniscient leader.</p>
  <p>Fourth, and perhaps most importantly, I model for my team that improvement is of the highest value and that no one should shy away from asking for feedback.</p>
  <p><strong>‍</strong></p>
  <p>Perhaps we are trained and incentivized to always appear competent, knowledgeable, and independent. Maybe that is how we got our management jobs in the first place, right? However, we <em>highly recommend </em>that you try this. Ask your team, ""What can I do differently to improve"", and see what happens. We guarantee this will lead to a positive outcome for you and your team.</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <h2>Number 5: Inspire Through Feedback and Recognition</h2>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>In the Swabian region in Germany, an area known for its productivity, Cuckoo clocks, and a general no-nonsense way of life, the following saying exists: ""<em>Nothing said is praise enough""</em>. In other words, if you are not criticized, think of it as praise. Seemingly many American managers agree; our data shows that managers have a hard time giving constructive feedback and motivating employees with praise.</p>
  <p><strong>‍</strong></p>
  <p>Why is this so hard? We cannot be sure but we assume that many managers assume that praise will cause their employees to lean back. An entirely pessimistic view of human motivation may underlie this philosophy: Humans only work hard to evade getting yelled at and avoid other forms of punishment. They are not driven by a desire to make things they can be proud of. Any form of praise will make them kick back and call it in.</p>
  <p><strong>‍</strong></p>
  <p>Nothing could be further from the truth. We want to be seen and recognized for our hard work, our ideas, our effort. Praising your employees will make them go the extra mile and fill their emotional bucket. This does not mean that low performance should not be called out (more about that later).&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>‍</strong></p>
  <p>Try it out: in your next team meeting, publicly praise specific team members for things they have done right, for example staying late, coming in early or having a particularly good idea. And then observe, if this will lead them to “kick back”. Don’t be a Swabian, praise loudly and publicly. </p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>By addressing these five common leadership habits, you can take a significant step towards becoming a more effective and inspiring leader. Remember, leadership is a journey, not a destination. Continuously strive to learn, grow, and adapt to the ever-changing demands of your role. With dedication and perseverance, you can build a successful and fulfilling career as a leader.</p>

Isn’t that what we believe our technology partners are doing? After a week at the Human Resources Technology Conference in Las Vegas, it sure seems like that is just what they are doing. The embracing of artificial intelligence as the norm rather than a trendy addition to be cast aside within a couple of years was visible in almost all the platforms on display. Closing the divide in how that AI will be used – both from compliant and workflow perspectives – has been an obvious goal of these HR management, payroll and learning systems.</p>
<!--more--><p>AI-driven HR solutions are here. There is more to grow into, but we certainly saw enough to know that AI is powering much of what’s going on.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>AI-Powered Recruiting:</strong> At the forefront of AI in HR was its application in recruiting. An applicant tracking system without some level of generative AI was nowhere to be found. The level of commitment to this advancement was clear with the variety of both established ATS as well as for the few in the startup pavilion. Streamlining the hiring process by automatically screening candidates, analyzing resumes, and even conducting initial interview stages. These platforms utilize natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to match candidate skills, experiences, and cultural fit with job requirements faster and more accurately than traditional methods.</li>
<li><strong>Employee Experience and Engagement:</strong> AI was also used to enhance employee engagement by providing personalized feedback, automating administrative tasks, and predicting employee turnover. We saw tools that analyzed workforce data to improve employee satisfaction, retention, and productivity, ultimately transforming workplace culture. We are even able to provide responsiveness to employees at regular intervals throughout a year, not only during the performance appraisal season.</li>
<li><strong>AI Ethics in HR:</strong> As AI became more embedded in HR processes, ethical considerations became paramount. There were conversations around bias mitigation in AI algorithms, data privacy, and the responsible use of AI in decision-making, ensuring that technology was applied fairly and equitably across diverse workforces. We are not fully there yet. However, what was shown during the conference is more advanced than even 12 months ago.</li>
</ol>
<p>Skill assessment tools saw significant advancements, too. With the shifting demands of the labor market, skill assessments have become critical for hiring, reskilling, and upskilling employees. The wise use of AI-powered, skill-based assessment platforms took up another large portion of conversations on the Expo floor. Our challenge is to incorporate more of this approach to talent acquisition as well as lifecycle talent management. Too often, we heard about companies only handling the entry-point candidate experience instead of a more holistic application to the entire talent experience.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>AI-Driven Skill Assessments:</strong> AI was integrated into skill assessment platforms to create adaptive testing environments. These platforms adjusted the difficulty and scope of assessments in real-time, based on the candidate’s responses. This allowed companies to more accurately measure a candidate’s abilities, ensuring that the right skills were identified for specific roles.</li>
<li><strong>Durable Skills Assessments:</strong> The importance of soft skills, such as communication, leadership, and problem-solving, was increasingly recognized in today’s job market. Innovations in skill assessments included AI tools that evaluated these critical but often intangible skills through behavioral analysis and gamified assessments. Attendees explored tools that analyzed communication patterns, body language, and even emotional intelligence. Plum is doing some great work in this area.</li>
<li><strong>Reskilling and Upskilling:</strong> As industries rapidly evolved, so did the need for employees to continuously learn and adapt. The conference highlighted platforms designed to assess current skill levels and provide tailored learning paths for employees looking to advance their careers. These tools were pivotal in addressing skills gaps and preparing the workforce for future challenges.</li>
</ol>
<p>It will be exciting to see how much advancement happens in a year if this past year is any indication. Even if you’re not responsible for tech purchasing for your HR needs, it behooves you to pay attention to what is happening. And Vegas is always a good place to take it all in.</p>","https://cdn.humareso.com/hubfs/Humareso%20Blog%20Posts-2-Defining%20Talent.jpeg","","PUBLISHED","false"

As a kid comic book enthusiast, I would spend hours reading the adventures of various superheroes. When those stories came to life on the small or big screen, I was front and center (still am, truth be told). Steve Austin, <a href=""https://watch.plex.tv/show/the-six-million-dollar-man/season/1"">The Six Million Dollar Man</a>, was a stud. He was the world’s first bionic man. For those of a certain age, do you remember this mid-1970’s TV Show intro? “Steve Austin. A man barely alive. Gentlemen, we can rebuild him. We have the technology. We have the capability to build the world’s first bionic man…Steve Austin will be that man. We can make him better than he was before. Better…Stronger…Faster.” YES! I was hooked. He was built to be the best.</p>
<!--more--><p>We may have fallen into a misdirected expectation of such a build for our employees. Obviously, there is no $6,000,000 budget per employee for such development (wouldn’t that be nice?). However, do we expect our employees to behave and produce as if that level of budget has been invested? Now before you shake your head no, think about it. How many times have you thought or said, “Why does {this person} act like this?” or more likely, “What is wrong with {this person}?” Admit it; you have.</p>
<p>What if the truth is that the person is operating at the level of awareness and education given? Our expectation of someone without confirmation of investment to that learning level or self-awareness factor is our fault, not theirs, right? Let’s pretend that I yelled at one of my children (imagine it…never happened…<em>fingers crossed</em>) for doing something that, in my opinion, they should have known not to do. Those big, beautiful eyes would look up at me in confusion. And that child would be right if I had not shared previously why to avoid or to act upon something. The knowledge would have been helpful. It may not have kept them from doing the opposite anyway (ah, kids), but that would be a different conversation.</p>
<p>And we may jump to shouting or scaring a child when they go running into the street. We go into quick-response protection mode. That’s not what we’re speaking of here. This is about development. This is about those competencies such as critical thinking, project management, time management and creative approaches. We often have this expectation of our staff with very little investment in their curation.</p>
<p>Our excuses will be that we don’t have a budget or time. We might be okay with the shadow of activity rather than the reality of productivity because of these constraints. Fine, but look at the performance appraisals of various team members. How many have ratings based upon skills, aptitudes and knowledge that the organization has not helped to foster? Be honest. Look at the real investment of learning that has occurred, not just the first-day sharing of user name and password for the LMS.</p>
<p>It is not going to be true that every organization is failing at this. It isn’t. But it’s worth looking at every so often.</p>
<p>For many of us, our organizations are cutting back. Trying to walk into Finance with a list of demands might be met with disdain. This idea of doing more with less is not a new concept to human resource practitioners. We know that we will still need to train and develop staff regardless. Let’s not grow weary of doing so, even if we don’t have that $6 million budget. We can’t build Steve Austin, okay, but we can build Marcy, Tim, Joann and Diego. We can work with what we have more deliberately. We have the technology. Our smartphones alone have more technology in them than the computers used to build the Six Million Dollar Man. Use those to start. We have the capability.</p>

  <p>By J. <a href=""mailto:kevin@rhabit.co"">Kevin Kelly</a>, Rhabit CEO, and co-founder</p>

  <p>‍</p>
  <p>I hold a simple belief: When faced with feedback, validating others moves you forward.</p>
  <p>Something that helped me move forward professionally in my own development was learning how to validate the responses, opinions, and feelings of others.&nbsp; I think when you’re young, confident, and have the type of personality that likes to challenge assumptions and has strong opinions, you’re naturally going to rub some folks the wrong way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Well, if rubbing people the wrong way in this sort of manner was a sport, at one point in my career&nbsp; I was Labron James.&nbsp; I assumed I knew better than everyone else and that their <a href=""http://rhabitanalytics.com/solutions"">feedback</a> was wrong.&nbsp; What I would ultimately come to learn is that this type of thinking fundamentally limited my growth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I’ve always loved problem-solving, it’s certainly my drug of choice, and probably why I’m running an HR tech startup where there’s no shortage of interesting and challenging problems to solve both in our domain of people products and in the challenge of building and running a company.</p>
  <h1><strong>Reframing problems to understand the solution</strong></h1>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>When we look at problems here at <a href=""http://rhabitanalytics.com"">Rhabit</a>, I’m always encouraging the team to suggest a variety of approaches - it’s always safe to explore theoretical approaches that are contrarian in nature and sometimes just plain strange - not because we’ll use these approaches but because in this widening of considered solutions it often sparks something that’s tangential to a classic approach but burrows just enough from something outlandish and imaginative to really produce something clever.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>If you consider that interacting with a team and working together with others is a problem to solve that fundamentally benefits your career (I think this realization was necessary as well for my personal professional growth), by not truly considering and treating the complaints, opinions, or perceptions of others as valid, I fundamentally narrowed the possible ways I could look at the world or solve the problem of working well with folks in order to find success.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>

  <h1><strong>The long-tailed benefits of validating the others’ feedback, even when it’s not what you want to hear</strong></h1>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>There are other <a href=""https://culturespecialist.com/employee-validation/"">positive effects</a> of validating the opinions of others as well.&nbsp; People who feel validated when they provide feedback are more likely to accept apologies, more likely to forgive you for mistakes you’ve made, and more likely to be willing to continue to work with you or trust you.&nbsp; Blowing off the opinions of others, even if they truly are backward or just plain wrong, produces nothing of value to you in your own career.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <blockquote>
   <strong>When you’re faced with negative feedback, your best bet is to push yourself to accept it with as much grace as possible - and (this is the important part), take a moment to consider the “what if” of the implications that this feedback is accurate and correct and what you should do with it if it is indeed true.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </blockquote>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p><strong>That last step is a biggie, but it’s very important</strong>.&nbsp; You need to let it sit in your head a bit and create some healthy dissonance with how you see the world.&nbsp; A perception that counters your own is a chance for you to explore the vantage point of someone else emotionally, and any perspective gained from that experience is always in your favor.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <h1><strong>Negative feedback conversations require empathy, understanding, and validation (and sometimes a dash of patience)</strong></h1>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>The other day we had an employee at one of our clients who received negative feedback on <a href=""http://rhabitanalytics.com/about-us"">our platform</a> about their behavior.&nbsp; This person wrote in directly to our support team complaining about our platform treating them unfairly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>We, as we always do, took it very seriously and looked into the matter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>We validated that the negative feedback this person was receiving was accurate, from multiple sources over an extended period of time.&nbsp; This person, instead of validating that feedback, immediately fought vigorously to counter and invalidate that feedback.&nbsp; All of this energy and effort was placed not into taking the <a href=""https://www.rhabitanalytics.com/post/hrchat-interview-results-through-employee-feedback"">feedback</a> as valid and pushing themselves to improve but instead lashing out in spite and impotent rage because they didn’t like facing a reality where people found them difficult to work with.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This illustrates my point exactly, that validating feedback is a better healthier use of time and energy and it produces better outcomes for yourself and for your team.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>So, the next time you get some feedback on your <a href=""https://www.rhabitanalytics.com/post/how-to-build-and-measure-leadership-behaviors-that-increase-employee-engagement-productivity"">behavior</a>, take a moment to assume it’s valid, acknowledge the validity of the opinions of those that expressed it to you, and see what new approaches you may have an opportunity to take as you work to solve the problem of being a great teammate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Without Rhabit, employees may not be aware their behaviors are negatively impacting their peers. Rhabit Analytics gives employees the opportunity to give anonymous, objective feedback to those they work with on a frequent basis. If you’d like to see how Rhabit has a feedback platform that is both psychologically safe as well as scientifically valid, <a href=""http://rhabitanalytics.com/book-a-demo"">book a time</a> to meet with the team.&nbsp;</p>

  <h1>Designing Good Talent Management Means Making Tradeoffs</h1>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>No talent management process is perfect. &nbsp; There are always parts of it that are at odds with each other.&nbsp; You can build an intense, realistic simulation of every job you want to hire for and have an amazing selection process that’s so expensive the company can’t possibly sustain it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>You can make a rich, thorough, intensely detailed <a href=""/performance-management"">performance management</a> process and the effort that’s required for people to complete it will lead to widespread non-compliance.&nbsp; You can make an ultra-simple process that people are happy to follow and complete, and you’ll lack real usable data to take action on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>There are <em>always</em> tradeoffs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>The trick to building great processes is accepting that perhaps there is no harmonious state where you have amazing data, high compliance, low cost, and happy participants.&nbsp; These are four corners of a king size bed and you’re likely going to be armed with a queen size fitted sheet - it’s just the nature of how companies often support talent management organizations in terms of resources, power, and al the things that go into “process-craft”.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>So in a world where I think you’re simply going to be more sane and successful if you’re realistic with your expectations, coming to a certain state of zen with the idea that tradeoffs are to be expected and embraced will serve you well as a talent manager.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <h2><strong>Simplicity vs. Specificity</strong></h2>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>Of the common trade offs in talent management processes, I think the one that fascinates me the most is <strong>simplicity vs specificity</strong>.&nbsp; Based on what I’ve seen with working with everything from small companies to F100s is that there’s this deep and fundamental desire, sometimes just from the executives, but other times from the actual talent management organization itself, to create processes that are super specific and nuanced to their business.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>They must capture all of the rich detail of every job role and have these richly crafted definitions around what counts towards an employee's performance in order to define their success in the role.&nbsp; Huge, voluminous tomes of <a href=""https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/behavioral-competencies/leadership-and-navigation/pages/leadershipcompetencies.aspx"" target=""_blank"">competencies</a>,&nbsp; job descriptions, job profiles, job families, job levels, etc.&nbsp; They build these cathedral-like structures of information and craft these customized forms and tools to capture the data that’s required to properly execute their performance management. Then, ultimately sit alone in their artisanally crafted edifice because no one else in the business can use any of the information they’ve collected cross-functionally.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>Even in the more miraculous environments where this deep specificity of information around performance definitions for every role in a massive company has a decently compliance collection and review process (I’ve seen like maybe one of these ever), the fundamental data produced isn’t usable for problems of scale.&nbsp; It’s extremely cumbersome to aggregate, to clean, then analyze, to norm.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>QUOTE BLOCK: It’s this rich and deep irony of talent management - that problems of scale are best served by consistent, simply designed data and information that’s well integrated but companies of scale are often times naturally complex and there’s this want to have more specific processes that are tailored to this complexity and variety.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <h3><strong>Simplicity isn’t perfect either.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>Simple means things fall through the cracks.&nbsp; A simpler scale or simpler competency model might not feel like it really fits a meaningful chunk of the organization.&nbsp; You’ll be able to aggregate, analyze, and do all kinds of great things with nice consistent data - but then how accurate is it if it misses some of that specificity?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>One bet I’d be willing to make based on what I’ve observed in the real world is the fear of a lack of specificity in the information collected in performance management processes. More often than not it outweighs the fear of making something so deep and thorough that no one uses it, understands it, or can do anything practical with it outside of simply collecting it and making individual-based decisions off it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>The other, and potentially more interesting bet, is that this is a misplaced fear: that using a simpler structure at scale, even though there are tradeoffs and potentially very real gaps in how that process fits in all roles in the company are the better trade-off.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <h2><strong>My reasoning for this? Time. &nbsp;</strong></h2>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>Time flows like a river.&nbsp; If you opt for a simpler process, it’s easier to implement, roll out, experiment, and evaluate continuously.&nbsp; Over time, you can really start to understand if the shortcomings of simplification are truly having an impact or not.&nbsp; You can do this on a much shorter time scale than you would need to build an incredibly customized approach that’s thorough and more specific to every role in the organization.&nbsp; This is also something that’s testable at small scales to start, which I always encourage talent managers to consider.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>Use pilot groups and centers of excellence models to try out new approaches.&nbsp; Could a simpler performance management process work with fewer competencies, a much shorter data entry experience, and a streamlined review conversation template? Figure out a way to test it and see.&nbsp; The upsides of the tradeoffs along the way may be worth it, or maybe they won’t be, but you’ll understand the real implications of these tradeoffs.&nbsp;</p>

  <h1>Optimize Your Competencies for More Effective Feedback</h1>
  <h2>What should your feedback be focused on?&nbsp;</h2>
  <p>Feedback should focus on the behaviors that drive success for the individual and the company. This sounds a bit obvious and trivial but it’s the first place people often mess up when trying to provide feedback.</p>
  <p>The key to doing this right is making sure you define what employee actions drive success. Most successful companies know and understand what employee behaviors lead to success. In an ideal world, the drivers of success are summarized in what HR Managers call a <strong>Competency Model</strong>. The term alone is dry enough to put most people to sleep, but stick with us here — there’s something useful buried in the nomenclature.</p>
  <p>Competency models are standard in larger companies, but for smaller companies, including the amazing early stage startups First Round invests in, taking the time to thoughtfully construct a competency model is rare. For the sake of simplicity though, let’s just think of a competency model as a collection of all the drivers — the core things you do — that make you successful in your job. If your company does not have a competency model, no worries, we will explain how to work around this in a practical manner.</p>
  <p>So let’s say you’re an awesome tech startup that’s growing fast. Here is an example of a Competency Model for the role of a First Level Manager who oversees a team of software developers:</p>
  <p>1. <strong>Delegating Tasks</strong>: Empowering direct reports to execute well defined tasks and projects</p>
  <p>2. <strong>Creating a Performance Environment</strong>: Setting clear and actionable goals for the team and measuring team success</p>
  <p>3. <strong>Coaching</strong>: Helping direct reports to acquire important skills and use them on the job</p>
  <p>4. <strong>Planning and Project Management</strong>: Planning and managing complex projects and tasks</p>
  <p>5. <strong>Helping to Embrace Change</strong>: Helping others in the organization to cope with changing processes and requirements</p>
  <p>6. <strong>Providing Feedback: </strong>Providing useful feedback to direct reports</p>
  <p>7. <strong>Driving for Results:</strong> Being productive at work and completing work in a timely manner</p>
  <p>8. <strong>Taking Charge</strong>: Proactively addressing and solving problems</p>
  <p>This is just an example. Competency models can vary greatly from role to role and company to company, but this should give you an idea of what one might look like for the typical first level manager role. Usually a competency model exists for all job roles and levels.</p>
  <h2>Aiming feedback at the competencies</h2>
  <p>So now that we have a model, we know where our feedback should be focused.</p>
  <p>Yes, there will be times where <a href=""http://rhabitanalytics.com/solutions"">feedback</a> is involved outside the model — it is great for any person to hear that your effort saved the day, but it is even more critical to understand how one is doing regarding the everyday critical behaviors — the behaviors described in the competency model. These are the behaviors that don’t stick out and that may go unnoticed but they’re the things that over time truly drive success. However, if we get our competency model right, these behaviors do not go unnoticed because now feedback providers know what they need to look for and are more attentive to what matters.</p>
  <p>Once a company knows what behaviors drive success and has codified it in a model they have a blueprint of what behaviors to reinforce, develop, and provide feedback on.</p>
  <h2>Aiming Feedback at the right level</h2>
  <p>Imagine someone asks you to be more extroverted. It is hard to change that. In contrast, imagine someone gives you feedback that you often don’t inform the team about a change that affects them. This feedback aims at behavior and can be controlled through our actions.</p>
  <p>Using competencies for feedback is a great start, but it doesn’t do the whole job. You also have to ensure that you give feedback at the right level.</p>
  <p>A competency model is basically structured like a pyramid. At the bottom are intelligence, personality, towards the top are skills, knowledge, and behaviors. At the bottom of the pyramid are increasingly immutable characteristics. This is what you hire for because it either cannot be changed or takes intense prolonged effort to change. At the top are the skills that companies can develop and improve through feedback for example.</p>
  <p>A <em>good</em> competency in a competency model should have 3–5 observable behaviors. For example, Coaching is made up of setting expectations, modeling the desired behavior, offering support, and so forth. This is key — focusing on competencies means focusing on actions. And <strong><em>this</em></strong> is where all feedback should focused. Feedback that focuses on personality or intelligence is hard to act upon.</p>
  <p>Imagine someone asks you to be more extroverted. It is hard to change that. In contrast, imagine someone gives you feedback that you often don’t inform the team about a change that affects them. This feedback aims at behavior and can be controlled through our actions.</p>
  <h2>Finding the right competencies for a job</h2>
  <p>Competency models have many advantages. Virtually every talent management activity benefits from them. Competency models can be used as a template for new hires (what to look for), training and development (what skills to train) and succession management (what behaviors are expected in a senior role).</p>
  <p>For the purpose of feedback, Competency models allow users to focus their feedback at the relevant performance areas. <em>After all, competencies are collections of behaviors that are relevant for success</em>.</p>
  <p>We believe a sound competency model is the keystone that holds all talent management activity together. Building a competency model can be time consuming and for some companies it is a very political process. Defining what drives success is not always a straightforward conversation.</p>
  <p>What if you don’t have a competency model? What if Talent Managers in your organization are busy with other things at the moment? We believe managers can create a partial or functional competency model for their direct reports. While it is ideal to create a competency model with the help of Talent Managers or external consultant, a “home-made”, feedback-focused competency model is better than nothing.</p>
  <h3>Creating your own feedback-focused competency model</h3>
  <p>This brings us back to the folks that don’t have a competency model. Don’t sweat, even without a formal model you can take advantage of this structure with a relatively simple exercise:</p>
  <p>Start with the by asking yourself the key question: What behaviors, as in the <em>observable</em> things people do, drive success for our team? If your answer is for example “communication” or “focusing on the customer”, try to break it down further into observable behaviors. For communication, it could be: “The employee explains complex issue in a way that lay-people can explain”. For customer orientation if could be: “The employee asks questions to fully understand a problem raised by customer”. Force yourself to describe the success factors in observable terms. A bad example is: “The employee plans complex projects well”. Better: “The employee breaks a complex project into manageable elements”.</p>
  <h2>Getting started</h2>
  <p>Once you have a feedback-focused competency model in place, share it with your direct reports. It expresses your expectations and often direct reports can make meaningful additions. At the very least it should open the discussion regarding what is important for success. It’s also worth mentioning that it doesn’t have to be called a competency model! You can label it as your team’s core values or commitments .</p>

Still, the record increase in companies that have gone remote has given way to new understanding of how the two compare. One such lesson is that remote employees thrive under a different kind of leader. That’s right – the same traits that leaders used to rock their in-person teams may not translate as well in the virtual arena. Those leaders need to learn brand new skills in order to lead remote teams effectively. On the other hand, would-be leaders who’ve always exhibited those strengths more quietly may find themselves newly on the forefront of the leadership conversation. 5 mins","2024-08-11 17:02:28","2025-08-12T13:50:29.585Z","<div class=""uui-blogpost05_content-left"">

  <h2>For remote workers, achievement &gt; ascription.</h2>
  <p>Recent studies have shown that ascriptive leadership traits like confidence, intelligence, extroversion, and charisma often reign supreme for leaders of office-based teams. Conversely, remote teams lend leadership status to those they perceive to be:</p>
  <ul role=""list"">
   <li>organized</li>
   <li>competent</li>
   <li>responsive</li>
   <li>‘doers’ of the work itself</li>
   <li>good at keeping the team on schedule and focused on goals</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In other words, office environments tend to favor employees with ascriptive traits as leaders, while remote teams lend more weight to those who exhibit achievement traits.</p>
  <blockquote>
   <strong><em>“The ascendance of worker bees to remote leadership roles may provide validation – and even relief – to the legions of hard workers who have, for generations, watched charming colleagues rise to the top.</em>“</strong>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
   Arianne Cohen for BBC
  </blockquote>
  <h2>The goal posts have moved, but you can make them easier to find.</h2>
  <p>In addition to learning or re-learning those achievement traits, <a href=""http://mckinsey.com"">McKinsey</a> has emphasized that leaders of newly remote teams must:</p>
  <ul role=""list"">
   <li>create a feeling of togetherness despite separation; a <a href=""https://www.rhabitanalytics.com/post/developing-your-team-not-wasted"">‘virtual watercooler’</a></li>
   <li>cultivate the notion of a shared purpose</li>
   <li>instill trust with people outside of their own teams</li>
   <li>build rapport with new hires who have never seen the inside of the office</li>
   <li>communicate in a way that keeps everyone included</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Just to name a few.</p>
  <p>Okay, so what are the next steps for achieving this crucial environment for remote teams? Do your leaders know precisely how to build trust without borders, create unity without face time?</p>
  <h2>Leadership habits put success within reach for remote leaders.</h2>
  <p>What’s a leadership habit?</p>
  <p>Leadership translate key leadership habits into <strong>observable, intuitive, and measurable</strong> behaviors that leaders can begin emulating right away.</p>
  <p>Here is a roadmap that covers a few key remote leadership habits, including ‘achievement’-related skills like Dependability.</p>
  <p><strong>Connecting With Remote Teams</strong></p>
  <ul role=""list"">
   <li><a href=""https://www.rhabitanalytics.com/post/remove-stress-give-them-rest"">Involves remote team</a> members in all decisions that affect them.</li>
   <li>Keeps remote team members informed.</li>
   <li>Uses collaboration software to ensure remote people can track the team’s current tasks &amp; progress.</li>
   <li>Can easily be reached through phone, chat, email, etc.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Dependability</strong></p>
  <ul role=""list"">
   <li>Completes deliverables on time.</li>
   <li>Produces high quality work.</li>
   <li>Is on time for calls and meetings.</li>
   <li>Makes people aware ahead of time when a deadline cannot be met.</li>
   <li>Completes work assignments in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Communication</strong></p>
  <ul role=""list"">
   <li>Use easy to follow language.</li>
   <li>During a conversation, pay attention and don’t do other things on the side.</li>
   <li>When explaining something, be concise and get to the point quickly.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Build Trust</strong></p>
  <ul role=""list"">
   <li>Keep commitments and promises.</li>
   <li>Explain goals, objectives, and the reasons for pursuing them.</li>
   <li>Recognize team members fairly based on accomplishment, rather than preference.</li>
   <li>Do not take credit for the work of others.</li>
   <li>Admit mistakes.</li>
   <li>Listen and care about what others have to say.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Breaking key habits down into their everyday behaviors removes friction from the leadership development process. Leaders know that by emulating these discrete behaviors, they’re embodying leadership habits that empower their teams in a way that is in line with the company’s expectations.</p>
  <h2>Remember - remote or not, observable behavior change and effective measurement is key.</h2>
  <p>Your leaders will develop these new habits faster and more effectively with frequent feedback. Ideally, the feedback process you employ will be easy, frequent, accessible, and psychologically safe. Doing this will help you operationalize faster behavior change – and communicate its impact on the business – for the leaders at your organization.<br><br>Ready to give your managers the tools to be effective remote team leaders?&nbsp;<a href=""http://rhabitanalytics.com/lp/feedback-culture"">Book a demo </a>of Rhabit to learn how!</p>

  <h1>Leaders Need These 2 Things To Be Successful</h1>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>All signs point to big changes this year. Predictions abound related to changes in where we’ll work, when we’ll work, and what organizations will need to be successful in what is hoped to be a year of recovery for many. </p>
  <p>As your organization flexes to meet oncoming challenges, your employees will look to their leaders for courage and clarity. Give those leaders what they need to lead with a clear blueprint for success and continuous feedback throughout.</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <h2>#1: Leadership Habits<br></h2>
  <h6>As talent developers, you know the leadership behaviors that drive engagement and business impact:</h6>
  <ul role=""list"">
   <li>Trust</li>
   <li>Collaboration</li>
   <li>Communication</li>
   <li>Inspiration<br>‍</li>
  </ul>
  <p><a href=""http://rhabitanalytics.com/leadership-development"">Leadership habits</a> like these make teams out of individuals and make goals feel real and achievable. But they don’t come naturally to everyone, and your leaders need more than biannual workshops and on-demand learning to nail them.</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <blockquote>
   Clearly defined habit goals give leaders what they really need to ace those habits: clear and actionable behaviors they can begin emulating right away.
  </blockquote>
  <p>‍</p>
  <h3><strong>Leader Behaviors That Build Trust:</strong>‍</h3>
  <ul role=""list"">
   <li>Keep commitments and promises.</li>
   <li>Don’t take credit for the work of others.</li>
   <li>Be transparent about what you want and why.<br>‍</li>
  </ul>
  <h3><strong>Leader Behaviors That Foster Collaboration:</strong>‍</h3>
  <ul role=""list"">
   <li>Be readily available to support team projects.</li>
   <li>Share important information quickly.</li>
   <li>Help others when they are running out of time.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3><strong><br>Leader Behaviors That Enable Clear Communication:</strong>‍</h3>
  <ul role=""list"">
   <li>Use easy to follow language.</li>
   <li>During a conversation, pay attention and don’t do other things on the side.</li>
   <li>When explaining something, be concise and get to the point quickly.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>‍</p>
  <h3><strong>Leader Behaviors That Inspire Teams:</strong><br></h3>
  <ul role=""list"">
   <li>Praise team members when they work hard.</li>
   <li>Listen to others’ ideas and take them seriously.</li>
   <li>Help others understand how their work contributes to the success of the team and company.<br>‍</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>These behaviors are anything but ‘set it and forget it’!</strong></p>
  <p>Revisit them throughout the year to ensure your leaders have the most updated habits to adapt to new or unexpected changes. Here, we adjusted the target behaviors related to Communication to address the new needs of a team that’s gone remote.</p>
  <h3>Behaviors That Promote Clear Communication (Remote Edition)</h3>
  <p>Stay easy to reach by phone, email, and chat.<br>Ensure each teammate is well-informed and understands what is currently going on. <br><a href=""https://www.rhabitanalytics.com/post/leading-remote-teams-leadership-habits-that-work-from-a-distance"">Check in with teammates</a> frequently to know what they’re working on and what they need.</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <h2>#2: Continuous Feedback</h2>
  <p>Psychologically safe confirmation that it’s working</p>
  <p>As these leaders begin to adjust their behaviors, they’ll need constant feedback to understand whether their efforts are working. After all, some of these behaviors will be brand new for them!</p>
  <p>Continuous feedback is the answer here. Implement a process where each leader receives frequent feedback from their closest coworkers on how closely they’re aligning to each behavior in their blueprints. This approach will enable your leaders to try new behaviors and quickly see if their method is working. It also prevents them from unwittingly doing the wrong thing for months between assessments.</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <h3>Tips for a successful continuous feedback process:<br></h3>
  <p><strong>Make it anonymous.</strong> Feedback providers will feel more safe to be honest if their names aren’t tied to their input.<br><strong>Make it fast and easy.</strong> No writing allowed! Feedback providers are more likely to submit feedback if it’s easy to do.<br><strong>Work smart, not hard. </strong>Ask feedback providers how frequently the leader exhibits each behavior in the blueprint. This way, the leader can immediately see which habits they’re getting right, which have fallen into their blindspot, and exactly how to fix it.</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p><strong>In conclusion – you got this!</strong></p>
  <p>Your organization will face new challenges and and continue to change – but with the right processes in place, your leaders will be ready for anything the new year throws their way.

  <h1>The Case for Continuous Feedback in Modern Organizations</h1>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>Clients often approach us with the question: <strong>“Why should we be doing continuous feedback? Why is it better?” </strong>Although I do believe the answer is a no-brainer (spoiler alert: continuous feedback is more effective in every conceivable way), I do appreciate the question.</p>
  <p>Many of our clients, just like much of the HR and Talent Management community, have been trained over decades on the “gold standard” of feedback: the 360-feedback process. The 360-feedback model has become orthodoxy, canon, dogma in US corporations and is often synonymous with feedback in general.</p>
  <p>Here is my deliberate, well thought-through answer to why companies should invest in continuous feedback.</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <blockquote>
   “Continuous feedback for everybody is a reality already. The question is not why should we give everybody feedback? Instead, the question is why wouldn’t we?.”
  </blockquote>
  <h2>‍<br>Feedback must be realtime</h2>
  <p>The traditional 360-feedback process makes a flawed assumption: It assumes that human behavior is stable. If we give feedback in a <a href=""http://rhabitanalytics.com/leadership-development"">360 review</a>, we have to think back across long periods of time, maybe years. During this time, our behavior may be changing and fluctuating. </p>
  <p>Here is an example: good coaches hold the learner accountable for their progress or lack thereof. However, they may not always do it and under all circumstances. Maybe during challenging projects, a manager does not hold learners accountable. Maybe the manager is a “fair weather coach” who drops their coaching behavior whenever times are tough. This will not be picked up by a 360 review. </p>
  <p>Most managers get a 360 review once or twice in their career. This cannot possibly be enough to show the manager how his coaching behavior fluctuates and when. Continuous feedback, in contrast, unearths these contingencies and allows the feedback recipient to open their eyes to situations that may block them from using this valuable coaching behavior.</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <blockquote>
   Good coaches hold the learner accountable for their progress or lack thereof.
  </blockquote>
  <p>‍</p>
  <h2>Continuous feedback allows us to learn</h2>
  <p>The human brain can do amazing things. Close your eyes and ask yourself which letters are above and below the letter K on your keyboard. You probably did not know, at least not with certainty, that the I and the M are right underneath (assuming you are using a standard US American Keyboard). However, if you are an experienced computer user you can likely find the I and the M when you type without thinking about this. You have learned through endless rounds of trial and error learning how to find these keys.</p>
  <p>This also applies to our behavior at work. What works in a presentation? What works in a conflict situation? What works with a crisis? Effective behavior in these situations is rarely taught, but we can learn them if we know what we did wrong and what we did right. In other words, we need to have an error signal, commonly known as feedback.</p>
  <p>Without this check-engine light of human behavior, we cannot differentiate between effective and ineffective responses, because we simply don’t know that something is wrong.</p>
  <h2><br>Continuous feedback drives motivation and meaning</h2>
  <p>Humans have the innate and stable need to be able to effectively deal with their environment. We all, whether we are flipping burgers or designing award winning brands, have the desire to be competent. The experience of competence is a basic human need. This is not a recent fad; this is a core tenet of Deci and Ryan’s Self-Determination Theory (1985, 2000) and has been around for a while. <strong>Good things come out of feeling competent.</strong></p>
  <p>When we feel competent to perform a task, it will be motivating for us and also provide us with meaning. In fact, experiencing one’s own competence and the growth of our competency is very motivating and inherently meaningful.</p>
  <p>However, what do we need to know that we are competent? What do we need to understand if we are capable? You guessed it: we need <a href=""https://www.rhabitanalytics.com/post/podcast-why-feedback-matters-for-leaders"">feedback</a>. Moreover, we don’t need this feedback once in a career or once every two years. We need this feedback to motivate ourselves and experience meaning continuously.</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <blockquote>
   “Employees who experience meaning in their job and feel that they take home more than just a paycheck are likely to stay and work well, with high levels of motivation.”
  </blockquote>
  <h2><br>Continuous feedback drives productivity</h2>
  <p>I mentioned earlier that feedback is an “error signal” or evidence if something is working or not. Using this behavioral “check engine light” we can adjust our behavior. We can tinker, tweak, and tune. How often do we want this error signal?</p>
  <p>Traditional 360 tools are often used once in a career; some lucky executives will complete one every few years. <a href=""https://www.rhabitanalytics.com/post/why-performance-reviews-create-dread"">Performance reviews</a>, even in best case scenarios, are once per quarter. Can we accept people making mistakes in absence of this error-signal for months, maybe even years?</p>
  <p>The answer is clearly no. Especially for leaders, I would argue that some behaviors should not be tolerated at all. Failure of leaders in the Diversity and Inclusions space may permanently damage their relationship with others. Feedback should be swift, clear, or as we call it, continuous so that ineffective behavior can be corrected immediately.</p>
  <h2><br>Continuous feedback is for everybody</h2>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>When 360-feedback tools became available, they were a tool for the few. In the 1980s when, for example, GE under Jack Welch started using them, they were distinctly for leaders. This made a lot of sense at the time. A 360-tool had to be assembled, printed, distributed, scanned, evaluated, and turned into a report. Participants and feedback providers had to be manually managed and tracked. Understandably, a 360 was an occasional event and certainly not for everybody.</p>
  <p>However, dare I say it, technology has changed. In the 1980s, computers were rare, email non-existent, and mobile phones were the exception (forget about smart phones). Today, many of us can work remotely thanks to cheap internet, smart phones, and a workplace that exists in the cloud. Why have 360s not evolved and become ubiquitous?</p>
  <p>I can only speculate, but I assume the traditional high price of a 360 was one factor. I assume 360 vendors did not want to commoditize this product and make it go the way of the engagement survey. The other factor was likely the <a href=""https://www.rhabitanalytics.com/post/what-if-we-took-hr-out-performance-management"">high administrative</a> burden. As a result, I assume, the 360-degree feedback was maybe regarded as a privilege or rite-of-passage for managers, not a tool for the masses.</p>
  <p>At this point in the year, Rhabit has collected hundreds of thousands of pieces of feedback. Our average client gets tens of thousands of feedback data points per month. This process is automated, and no administrator had to send one email, one reminder, or create one report. It runs in the undercurrent of the organization, continuously collecting feedback and delivering feedback to leaders - and high-impact insights for talent managers. </p>

  <p>If you are thinking about one single initiative that will drive productivity, meaning, retention, and employee growth, think about evolving your current 360 program and make it available, continuously, to many or most of your employees.</p>

  <h1><strong>The Business of Setting Great Goals</strong></h1>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>Every company I’ve observed implementing a <a href=""http://rhabitanalytics.com/performance-management"">performance management</a> process that actually works has one thing in common - they teach their employees how to set good quality goals for themselves, and a defining factor in this is the goals reflect a fundamental understanding of the business.</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>In larger companies, as roles become narrower in their function, the challenge can be that individual contributors and even managers may lack a fundamental understanding of the mechanics of the <a href=""https://www.rhabitanalytics.com/post/beyond-smart-aligning-goals"">business model</a> of the company.&nbsp; What this does, is it makes it hard for those people to not only understand how their work connects to the success of the company, but it also makes it hard for them to come up with high-quality goals for themselves based on what they understand about their role.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <h2><strong>How can leaders create great goals?&nbsp;</strong></h2>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>This is something I encourage the leaders I talk to and the talent management executives we work with to make a priority in their development process and their communication strategy around performance management.&nbsp; When teaching a new employee how to use the performance management process, this is a great time to not only teach them about goal structures like SMART goals, OKRs, etc, but to also contextualize that structure with how their business actually operates - how it generates revenue, what costs it incurs, and where their role connects to the businesses operations itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <blockquote>
   If you work to combine a good structure, which honestly is the easy part, with a good quality education around the business acumen pieces required to understand where an employee's role connects to the business model, you’re set up for high-quality goals.&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </blockquote>
  <p>‍</p>

    <img src=""https://cdn.humareso.com/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/631779b39545087d3292454c_Screen%20Shot%202022-09-06%20at%2012_47_32%20PM.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt="""">
   </div>
  </figure>
  <h2><strong>Why is building a goal-setting process important?&nbsp;</strong></h2>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>This is the absolute cornerstone of a good performance management process, regardless of the tools and structure you use.&nbsp; Suppose you don’t have people working on goals that fit tightly with the business’s operations. In that case, it won’t matter if you’re good at the other things like creating transparency, communicating progress, helping to remove barriers, etc. A poor quality goal that gets achieved doesn’t move the needle for the business and it also makes it less likely that the person achieving it will get the recognition and reward they deserve, which feeds into a negative cycle of performance, all because the goal quality was low.&nbsp;</p>
  <h3><strong>So where to start?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>This is something you can audit through structured conversations or even an effective surveying tool.&nbsp; Some of our own customers at Rhabit do a great job of checking this continuously by measuring if they feel like their work makes an impact on the success of the company and their manager has explained how their work connects to the business.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <blockquote>
   Measurement is a great way to diagnose the state of business acumen within your organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </blockquote>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>I would also encourage you to look at your onboarding process.&nbsp; What is the experience that new employees go through that teaches them about how the business and their role intersect?&nbsp; <a href=""https://www.rhabitanalytics.com/post/future-of-feedback-bottom-up"">Talk to your leaders</a> about how they communicate the importance and impact of the roles their people have in the company when they bring in new team members.&nbsp; Make this a fundamental part of your leadership development training.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>Lastly, spot-check goals people create in your performance management system to see if you fundamentally understand how they connect to the business.&nbsp; If you don't, consider reaching out to that person’s leader to try to learn more - this can often be a great way for talent managers and HR to learn more about the business itself, which only increases your chance of being successful in your own role.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>If the goal still doesn’t make sense, this is a great time to work with that leader to improve their own understanding of your performance management system and what good quality goals look like by involving more senior leaders in the organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <h3><strong>What’s next for creating a scalable goal-setting process?</strong></h3>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>If you’re interested in learning more about great performance management methods and approaches, we’d love to speak with you and perhaps show you some of the ways we <a href=""http://rhabitanalytics.com/case-studies"">create high-performance</a> environments by combining <a href=""https://www.rhabitanalytics.com/post/continuous-feedback-modern-organizations"">continuous feedback</a> on interpersonal skills with easy-to-use goal tracking and automation for 1:1 agendas and data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>As <a href=""https://www.siop.org/"">organizational psychologists</a>, we’ve worked tirelessly to create a system that’s simple and helps managers focus on their people instead of filling out forms, and we’d love a chance to show you how we’ve done it.&nbsp;</p>

  <h1>WHAT IF WE TOOK HR&nbsp;OUT OF THE PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT PROCESS?</h1>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>I’m completely aware of how controversial the idea of taking performance management out of HR’s hands might sound, but bear with my potential blasphemy for a moment to explore this idea, which I think has real merit.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍<br></p>
  <h2><strong>PERFORMANCE IS A LEADERSHIP PROBLEM.</strong></h2>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>Maintaining alignment between what’s being worked on or produced by employees and the strategic direction of the organization falls squarely on the shoulders of leaders in the organization.&nbsp; Good managers wake up in the morning and think about how they’re enabling the people on their team to be the best version of themselves and give them support to produce amazing results.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍<br></p>
  <blockquote>
   “If it’s their fundamental job to drive performance, why does the management of performance, the measurement, the policy, the communication, and all of the innovation (or lack thereof) come from HR?”&nbsp;&nbsp;
   <br>
  </blockquote>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>Of course it classically makes sense.&nbsp; People perform, HR owns people processes, HR should own the PM process for those people.&nbsp; It’s not surprising or contradictory in any means - but what if we put that aside for a second and looked at making Performance Management a process designed, implemented, and owned by leaders.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍<br></p>
  <h2><strong>WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE IF HR&nbsp;DIDN'T OWN THE PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT PROCESS?</strong></h2>
  <h3><strong>‍</strong><br></h3>
  <p>In terms of designing a <a href=""/performance-management"">performance management</a> process, your leaders are closer to the actual operation of the business and what drives success.&nbsp; Someone from HR or talent management has to learn or try to systemize fundamental understanding of the skills utilized and the measurement of meaningful output for every role in the organization.&nbsp; Just writing that out seems daunting - but in a decentralized model where HR facilitates this rather than owning it, the manager’s knowledge can be utilized in the design of a measurement process that better fits the role.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>
  <p>One strategy we’ve seen play out well is shifting away from large nebulous strategic goals as the main measure of an individual employee's success and rather coming up with a method that’s more focused on work product quality and timeliness of delivery.&nbsp; The difference is subtle, but quite meaningful.</p>

    An example of Rhabit's smaller, time-bound, measurable objectives.

  <p>‍</p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>When employees have crisp definitions of what they’re on the hook to deliver and when it’s due, we see in our data that they feel it’s a more fair process for evaluation.&nbsp; HR’s role in this is more focused on educating the leaders how to work within this framework and finding a way to meet their documentation requirements for compliance.&nbsp; This is where there’s an important flex for the modern HR organization - look to places where you can integrate pre-existing data.&nbsp; Modern platforms and technology should work for you - not create a separate form to fill out the same thing you’ve written down somewhere else.</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <h2><strong>THE DATA ABOUT THE WORK PRODUCT THAT EMPLOYEE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR - IS IT OUT THERE?&nbsp;</strong></h2>
  <h3><strong>‍</strong><br></h3>
  <p>Can it be captured from the initial point of entry and moved over to the systems involved with your performance management process? A key point of modern performance management is automation - with the goal being to have leaders and individuals spending as little time on data collection as possible for the PM process and having the PM process more focused on creating a space to have a data driven conservation supporting the growth and success of employees.</p>
  <p>‍<br></p>
  <blockquote>
   Focusing on the role of HR more towards facilitation and flexibility also helps build more trust between HR and the leaders they’re working with.&nbsp;&nbsp;
   <br>
  </blockquote>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>If your job is seen as someone who is responsible for enabling a leader to build low-friction processes for creating accountability within their team, you’re perceived as much more of a true partner than someone who is demanding they follow a rigid process whether it creates more work for their team or not.&nbsp;<br></p>
  <p>This means HR’s still involved - they set the scaffolding, train, and support - but the <strong>how, when, and what of performance measurement is now owned completely by the leade</strong>r.&nbsp; The leader’s output then becomes an evaluation of the quality of that process, shared with HR (this isn’t much different than today) and they’re held accountable to being consistent in delivering that output, but that’s it.</p>
  <p>‍<br></p>
  <h3><strong>SO NOW WHAT HAPPENS IF SOME EXTERNALITY ACTS ON THE BUSINESS?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br></h3>
  <p>A sudden market change or strategic move brings new priorities, tasks, etc.&nbsp; If now the role of the employees and what they produce changes and the PM process doesn’t feel like it fits the new business environment, the parts of the business that change would have to fight with HR to try and change the monolithic PM process to better suit the new realities of the business (such as more <a href=""/post/how-to-activate-a-new-strategic-initiative-with-behavioral-blueprints-and-continuous-feedback"">remote workers</a>, or new operations processes).&nbsp; An argument we would be prepared to make is that in many cases the leaders of these units are the ones who are undergoing the changes and have to adjust their people at the individual level, so why not allow them to freely change the how, when, and what is measured as part of the performance management process?&nbsp;<br></p>
  <p>This idea starts to scratch the surface of the concept of decoupling classic performance management from HR (or even the talent management or people operations organization, if that’s how your company labels them).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <h1><strong>Having trouble figuring out what your performance goals should be?&nbsp;</strong></h1>
  <h2><strong>Learn your company’s business model.</strong></h2>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>Setting goals is a great habit in general.&nbsp; Goals help motivate us, and they can fundamentally drive our own individual improvement and performance just as much as they can help the companies and organizations we work for perform. Studies by Edwin A. Locke and his colleagues, most notably Gary Latham, have shown that more specific and ambitious goals lead to more performance improvement than easy or general goals.</p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>So goals are good, ambitious goals are even better - got it, all good, so let’s make some goals.&nbsp; Super easy, right? Just come up with a novel, ambitious goal and do your thing, how hard can it be?&nbsp;</p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>Turns out it’s not that simple.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>We’ve been trying to crack the code on extensible and useful goal structures for a long time, and there are a few approaches you may have even encountered.&nbsp; One that’s quite popular that we’ve seen around for a long (in terms of management practices) time is the SMART goal, which tries to give you a helpful framework for forming your goals, and I do genuinely believe it’s an effective format, but going from the concept of the goal setting framework to an actual goal that resonates with you, can be a super frustrating exercise to some.&nbsp;</p>
  <p><br></p>

  <p><br></p>
  <p>Something I’ve both experienced myself and have observed in lots of other folks throughout my professional career is that when it comes time to set performance goals for a month / quarter / year, there are this sort phenomena where unless your job is fundamentally very metric driven (sales for example), it can be easy to stall out when faced with the task of articulating goals, particularly in the SMART format (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Timebound). <strong>&nbsp;If your leader doesn’t provide you with crisp guidance on what you should be working on and why, it can feel like a real burden to come up with these.&nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p><br></p>
  <h2><strong>So what do you do when you get stuck?&nbsp;</strong></h2>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>My coaching around this is to start by asking questions, specifically ask questions about the business model of the organization as it relates to you.&nbsp; Sometimes it may be many layers deep, but connecting the dots between the work you do in your role and how it ultimately drives a financial metric that’s meaningful to the company is the fundamental element you need in order to get to the “why” behind what you’re doing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <blockquote>
   I’m not talking about some abstraction of “why” or some emotional motivation of “why”, I’m talking about the fundamental mathematical “why” behind your role and its design to drive the performance of the company. &nbsp;
  </blockquote>
  <p><br></p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>The better you understand this, the better you can tune your goals, your tactics, your growth strategy, your communication, all the things that present you as a professional to your team and your organization.&nbsp; Knowing the fundamentals of the business is a singularly important part of finding professional success in your professional career, whether it’s a company you’re working for or a company of one.&nbsp;</p>
  <p><br></p>
  <h2><strong>That “why” drives everything.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>If you don’t know why your company has you doing the work you’re doing - don’t immediately panic and it’s not necessarily a sign that you’re on some forsaken voyage of a sinking ship. Companies are complex, and depending on their structure, the relative business acumen of your leaders, and the very culture of the company, it simply may be opaque not out of malice but out of sheer ignorance. This is a very <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor"">Hanlon’s Razor </a>view, a view I take quite often probably because I’m naturally an optimist, but I do think it’s a more probable explanation when you’re lost in terms of what your work really contributes to a large organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>The questions can be as simple as “how does my work contribute to the revenue of the company?”, but it really does need to seek to connect with the financial performance of the company.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>Of course, there are limits to this - perhaps you’re charged with driving some operational efficiency, maintenance, or other elements of operations that are abstracted from generating revenue.&nbsp; Maybe you’re in an area like HR that at times is viewed explicitly as a cost center <strong>(though we’d argue that the line between company performance and HR-centric metrics such as employee retention is becoming clearer and clearer)</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>You may not be able to get a clear picture immediately just from one question, but the point is to dig until you can.&nbsp; No matter how abstracted you are from the fundamental revenue generation mechanism of the company, it’s there, I promise you it’s there somehow and some way - and if it’s not, making it so is that much more of an opportunity to further increase your impact to the business and drive your success as a professional.&nbsp; If you don’t get a clear answer from your boss, look to your network, look to your network of peers, dig into materials within your company that are accessible to you, do whatever you can to uncover the clear connection between your role in the organization and the business model.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p><br></p>
  <h2><strong>Relevance is the key to creating goals</strong></h2>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>Once you have this, coming back to your goal is much, much simpler.&nbsp; The “R” in the SMART goal is done, it’s obviously relevant, and relevance resonates, this will make it that much easier to hit the other pieces. You’ll now have the context that drives the <em>Timebound</em> portion, a better sense of what’s <em>Achievable</em>, as well as a clear signal on how to <em>Measure</em> your progress towards the goal.&nbsp; All that’s left is to try and get <em>Specific </em>about the description of the goal, but this is by far the easiest part of the exercise once the other factors have fallen into place.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>I’m of the opinion that a goal that simply meets the <em>MART</em> criteria will inherently be sufficiently specific, but the folks that came up with it needed that S to be meaningful so the acronyms really stuck.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>Regardless of the goal framework you use, I think the argument for fundamentally pushing yourself to understand the business model of the company you’re working for is the missing piece of the puzzle for going from framework to action successfully. I’d encourage you to consider this as you either develop yourself professionally or if you’re one of those awesome learning and development folks we work with all the time at <a href=""https://rhabitanalytics.com?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=goals"">Rhabit</a>, think about how you can weave this content into experiences for your employees such as onboarding and continuous training experiences through their careers with your organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p><br>Understanding the fundamental business model can also be leveraged as a powerful context when you’re doing things such as designing a competency model or figuring out what behaviors you should be <a href=""https://www.rhabitanalytics.com/solutions/solutions?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=goals"">providing employees feedback</a> on that help foster a deeper understanding of the business within the culture of the organization.</p>

  <h1>Psychological Safety For Remote Teams: Beyond A List of Behaviors</h1>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>At the heart of every great team is psychological safety. It feeds into all the most critical elements of effective work teams.</p>
  <p>Communication.</p>
  <p>Trust.</p>
  <p>Collaboration.</p>
  <p>And we all know the legends and data surrounding it. From appearing at the top of Google’s list of what makes their teams effective, to how it hearkens back to Maslow’s Hierarchy, and research by heavy-hitters like Amy Edmondson, industry leaders have put out the rally cry:<br></p>
  <p>It’s time to nail psychological safety. And this year, we have to nail it for remote teams.</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <h2>Countless articles advise on ways to cultivate psychological safety for remote teams. But who's reading them?</h2>
  <p>As a talent leader, you definitely are. This isn’t a new topic – it’s been around for years. Still, the folks you really need these articles in front of – leaders at your company – are focused on executing their core job functions: sales, marketing, operations…</p>
  <p>Developing soft skills is as painfully secondary as it always was, especially given today’s challenges.</p>
  <p>But you know it’s not enough to recommend a few articles or even assign a workshop on a topic as crucial as psychological safety. </p>
  <p>These days call for more frequent reinforcement of the leader behaviors that nurture psychological safety.</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <h2>The list: leader behaviors that nurture psychological safety.<br></h2>
  <p>Amy Edmondson coined the term ‘psychological safety’, and defined it as ‘a shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking.’ So which leader behaviors create this shared belief? Based on Amy’s own words and industry research, we’ve drawn up a few right here:</p>
  <ol start="""" role=""list"">
   <li>Model curiosity – ask a lot of questions.</li>
   <li>Frame the work as a learning problem, not an execution problem.</li>
   <li>Acknowledge your own fallibility.</li>
   <li>Encourage team members to share new ideas, even if they aren’t fully fleshed out.</li>
   <li>Create an environment that promotes risk-taking.</li>
   <li>Design a process team members can follow to feel safe taking risks or trying new things.</li>
   <li>When others offer an improvement idea, review the idea and give it a fair shot.</li>
   <li>Support team members who ask clarifying questions and venture diverse ideas.</li>
   <li>Adopt new group norms with recurring opportunities for teammates to share recent instances where they took a risk – whether it worked or didn’t.</li>
   <li>Actively move viable innovative ideas into implementation.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>What would you add to this list? How else might a leader demonstrate a commitment to nurturing the psychological safety of their team?</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <h3>Beyond the list: demonstrate your company's commitment to psychological safety by reinforcing and measuring these behaviors.</h3>
  <p>After communicating clearly defined, observable behaviors like these to leaders, you’ll need a way to keep the behaviors front-of-mind and prove your commitment to them.</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <h3>Step 1: Collect frequent feedback on each leader’s alignment to specific behaviors.</h3>
  <p>When done correctly, continuous feedback frequently reminds leaders and employees of the behaviors your company values. </p>
  <p>Each week, ask each leader’s peers, managers, and direct reports how frequently that leader reflects each behavior. &nbsp;Make sure that their answers are anonymous – this is one way you can nurture psychological safety with the feedback process itself.</p>
  <p>Tip: Avoid requiring written responses. Feedback providers know their writing styles give them away, and often hold back on giving honest answers. Instill psychological safety by using a multiple choice format instead.</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <h3>Step 2: Give each leader access to their feedback data.</h3>
  <p>As feedback data rolls in, each leader gains insight into precisely which behaviors they excel in, and which ones they need to reflect more often in order to achieve an environment of psychological safety.</p>
  <p>Over time, leaders can visualize how their efforts are being perceived by their closest co-workers.</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <h3>Step 3: Reward and recognize leaders with high feedback scores.</h3>
  <p>Then, ask them how they were successful. How can you replicate their success across other teams? Is there an opportunity to pair one leader with another for mentorship work?</p>
  <p>Ideally, you’ll be able to compare performance data for top leaders and bottom performers to understand the impact of psychological safety on employee engagement and team performance.</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <h3>Remember - observable behavior change and measurement is key.</h3>
  <p>‍<br>Your leaders will develop new habits faster and more effectively when provided with intuitive leadership behaviors and frequent feedback. Ideally, the feedback process you employ will be easy, frequent, accessible, and psychologically safe. Doing this will help you operationalize faster behavior change – and communicate its impact on the business – for every employee at your organization.</p>

  <h1><strong>The Principal's Office Effect:&nbsp;Why Performance Reviews Are the Worst</strong></h1>
  <p>By J. Kevin Kelly, Rhabit co-Founder and CEO</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>I was not, and I’m sure this is hard for many of you that know me to imagine, the most rule-bound student. My kid is (thank god), and this is only because he gets it from his mother, but little Kevin was more mischievous by nature and was known on occasion to get himself into a little trouble. Rarely though, did my missteps ever truly escalate to the point where I was outside of my immediate teacher’s disciplinary options. There are of course a few exceptions over my years, but this is a leadership and work culture blog, not my personal confessional. In general though, I was a good kid and, again in general, I wasn’t the type that was looking to get in any real trouble.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>There were kids that did though, and when they were really in for it, you’d have that moment that we’re all familiar with - that inevitable crackle of the intercom coming through the room (do they still have intercoms at schools? Do you just got a What’s App from the administration office now?) and the interruptive and all too familiar refrain of “Mrs. {Kevin’s Teacher}, can you send {Person now facing their imminent doom, from my childhood perspective}&nbsp; to the principal's office?”.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>Cue the stares, unhushed commentary and chuckles, the sinking feeling and dread.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <figure class=""w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"">
   <div>

   </div>
  </figure>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>It’s fascinating to me as I look back that regardless of my guilt (which was the case most of the time) or innocence (self adjudicated of course), it always <em>felt</em> the same. Even if I <em>expected</em> the call, even if there was a warning well ahead of time, even if it was scheduled, expected, and <strong>meant to be positive</strong>, the feeling was always the same.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>Seriously, I remember I was once called to the Principal’s office for an award with a few other kids from the Academically Gifted program - again, do they still have this? (Anecdotally to me, the AG program was literally the only part of school I ever genuinely looked forward to), and I remember this not because of the relief that cascaded over my being as the realization of how I was not meant to face certain doom, but the fundamental dread that clung to me on the trip there.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>I don’t think this is a terribly unique experience, as evidenced by the colloquial phrase “<strong>getting called to the principal’s office</strong>” that you see in the context of work disciplinary events on shows like The Office or Parks and Rec. It’s a shared experience for many kids out there, and I think it really does translate into the modern world of knowledge work especially when we’re talking about the performance review.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <h2><strong>What causes performance review anxiety?</strong></h2>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>The traditional annual review is as close as we can get to getting called to the principal’s office as adults.&nbsp; The outcomes even have similar proxies in our mind - you can get suspended or expelled (fired), or they can call your parents (HR) which is really extra miserable. Of course there can be neutral or positive outcomes as well, but our brain never thinks about those.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <blockquote>
   “We never think about the award we might get or the praise that might be heaped upon in a time of success, all the unknowns manifest in anxiety around the negative outcomes. For lots of folks I’ve talked to about this - it’s not about whether you’d assess yourself as doing well or not, but the bulk of the anxiety comes from simply not knowing where you stand. It’s from a lack of information, not the result of an assessment, either imagined or real.”
  </blockquote>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>This is why when we’re working with companies that are trying to fundamentally redesign their <a href=""https://www.rhabitanalytics.com/solutions/performance-management?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=Principal"">performance management</a> process, we’re often focusing on a shift in transparency. Performance management processes are quite dense and (despite our best efforts) sometimes unavoidably complex, and there’s a variety of concepts to think about (this we talk about often in our content, <a href=""https://www.rhabitanalytics.com/post/psychological-safety-remote-teams?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=Principal"">Psychological Safety</a>, <a href=""https://www.rhabitanalytics.com/post/future-of-feedback-bottom-up?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=Principal"">Accountability,</a> etc.).&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>Transparency though, is one of the big ones that I think helps diffuse the anxiety bomb that employees minds can create when approaching a review. When I say transparency here, I’m specifically talking about the process and data used in a review conversation.&nbsp; Of these two, I’m of the belief that the data weighs much more than the process in terms of influencing the anxiety of the employee.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <h2><strong>If you walked into a review with your manager tomorrow, what would you expect to be greeted with?&nbsp;</strong></h2>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>If I asked you to pull up and show me the data about your performance that would be used in that review right now, could you do it easily? Is it something that’s accessible and viewable by yourself and your manager at any given time? If the answer to that question isn’t a yes, then you can quickly understand how someone might get anxious about exactly what will be referenced in a performance review.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>Now, let’s flip that around.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>Imagine you walk into an annual review, but in the days leading up to the formal review activity, months even, you could clearly see the precise data around what you’d accomplished and how you’re perceived by others as you accomplished it far ahead of time. You could see how this has changed over time in the lead up to the conversation, you could see the different questions or discussion points that would be covered in the review, and you could even see comments or thoughts from your manager far ahead of this event. You now have a new defense against that building anxiety of the review experience: You have time, you can plan, and you have facts as opposed to imagination.&nbsp;</p>

  <h2><strong>Better performance management tools make for better experiences</strong></h2>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>This is precisely the approach we’ve taken with product design at Rhabit. We wanted to build tools for performance reviews that set forth this structure on behalf of the employee. We don’t want you to feel like you’re being called to the principal's office unexpectedly. We want you to feel that the process which holds you and the other people you work with accountable for their performance is a fair and transparent one, where the data that is used to evaluate you is easily accessed and viewed at any time, and that you have time to plan ahead for conversations that, whether you dread them or not, really do matter in the future of your career.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>If you’re leading others, you have to resist the feeling that there’s a loss of control or power by employees having a more current and continuous ability to get feedback and monitor their performance. Being able to reference the data that determines the level at which they’re performing in their roles should be seen as a right, not a privilege, to employees. This equity of information is something that can serve you as a leader very well, based on our observations with our customers. The fewer surprised in the review conversation, the less intense the emotionality of the experience, and the less intense the experience, the more likely you are to have a good outcome that can focus on support and development from where you and your employee are today as opposed to focusing on whether or not the assessment of performance is simply accurate in the first place. This is the power of transparency in a performance management process that’s well designed.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>If you’d like to talk to us about how you might implement this in your own company, we’d love to <a href=""https://www.rhabitanalytics.com/learn-more-about-rhabit?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=Principal"">have a chat</a>. Whether you use the awesome stuff we’ve built here at Rhabit, or something else, we’re always willing to help share our expertise, observations, and data around what companies are doing to drive high performance work environments that people find fulfilling.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <p>It had been three years since I flew on a plane.&nbsp; The whole airport ritual felt strange and alien. &nbsp; I had forgotten how utterly graceless the experience of going through the security checkpoint is.&nbsp; I’m of the opinion that no self respecting adult dressed in business casual can get through this experience without looking like a clumsy oaf.&nbsp; The only solace to the whole thing is that it’s at least indiscriminate, and treats every person equally miserably.&nbsp; I also had forgotten how abysmally poor the experience of interacting with any airline for any reason is.&nbsp; It seems like an industry that’s business model now requires them to be antagonistic to their customers in order to sustain itself.&nbsp; The inside of an airplane on a domestic flight seems like it was designed for children, in that everything is slightly too small to actually be practical for an adult.&nbsp; The seat, overhead bins, walk ways, everything would be perfect if we were all four and a half feet tall and weighed seventy five pounds.&nbsp; I truly had forgotten how much I utterly despised travel on the whole.</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>After getting to Seattle last week, dropping off my stuff and wandering over to the venue, I eventually found myself in a hotel conference area completely indistinguishable from any other hotel conference lobby.&nbsp; I procured an absolutely face meltingly expensive stale beer from a man that didn’t like people and started to shuffle in the crowd and talk to folks at random.&nbsp; That’s when it all changed.&nbsp; Everyone there was so happy to be there.&nbsp; The people were sharp and passionate and they loved talking about the things I get spun up about - talent management, leadership development, performance management, feedback, employee experience, analytics, all of it, all the things I obsess over with my team at Rhabit, and this was the one place where I could do this, full bore, for three days straight, and no one would think twice about it.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>This was <a href=""/post/siop-2022-wrap-up-feedback-ignite-sessions-and-workplace-trends"">SIOP</a>.&nbsp; It’s one of my favorite events ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The pandemic took things like this away from me, away from everybody really, and I think finally going back really reminded me of how important it is for finding these places where you’re with “your people”.&nbsp; There’s so much value in sharing space with folks from different parts of the world, different roles, but whom all share an intense interest in a domain you yourself find interesting.&nbsp; It’s good for the soul.&nbsp; It’s fundamentally invigorating and one it’s hard not to be energized from the experience.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>Even it if means getting another variant of covid, even if it means suffering through the miserable experience of travel, and even if it means losing a few productive days of work to just hang out and build real relationships again, it’s all worth it.&nbsp; I see so much content about burn out.&nbsp; There were a couple of different panels at SIOP this year about the topic, which were well attended.&nbsp; I’ve seen everything from legit research around the topic to your typical sham huckster consultants on LinkedIn covering it, and I will tell you this, that the only anti-burnout experience I’ve ever had, was being around my people at SIOP.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>The deep fundamental irony that I am indeed not an actual organizational psychologist isn’t lost on me.&nbsp; I “married” into the discipline by starting Rhabit with Alexander, the actual Ph.D behind what we do here, but his love for the field has become my love for the field and a dose of the passion of others around a topic relevant to your career is just what the doctor ordered in terms of fighting burnout.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>What I’d love for you to do if you’re reading this (and if you love talent management, go to SIOP next year), see if there’s a place where you can be around your people.&nbsp; Whatever drives your actual passion, and the closer it is&nbsp; to your career, the better, but find a club, a group, a gathering, or make your own if you have to, but figure out a way to share common space with people who love what you love.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>In early 2019 this would have seen like such a mundane and uninteresting idea, but in 2022 as the world is just starting to at least be post-anxiety about the pandemic, this could be an opportunity to reignite your engine, to change your context, change your scenery, and get yourself re-engaged in the things you love.&nbsp; I promise you, it’s even worth the hassle of air travel (at least for now).&nbsp; </p>

  <h1>How To Build and Measure Leadership Behaviors That Increase Employee Engagement &amp; Productivity</h1>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>Between leadership training, assessments, and a myriad of other related resources, companies spend thousands of dollars per year on developing their leaders. And for good reason! From frontline manager, to mid-level director, and senior executive, this small group of people has an outsized impact on the <a href=""http://rhabitanalytics.com/employee-engagement"">employee experience</a> of everyone else at the organization. Their daily behaviors and efficacy directly influence employee engagement, productivity, and whether the company achieves annual goals. </p>
  <p>Still, company leaders struggle to answer basic questions like:</p>
  <ul role=""list"">
   <li>Who are my best leaders? What kind of habits do my leaders have, or need to improve?</li>
   <li>Which behaviors should my leaders emulate so that our employees feel more engaged and satisfied at work?</li>
   <li>How can I communicate those behaviors and hold leaders accountable to them in a measurable way?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The world is moving too quickly to rely on costly, event-based measurement tools like 360 assessments; one pile of data every 6 months (or 2 years!) won’t cut it anymore. Company <a href=""https://www.rhabitanalytics.com/post/leaders-need-these-2-things-to-be-successful"">leaders need visibility</a> into and control over the leadership behaviors affecting their employees’ experience and success every single day. Waiting months between assessments is simply too risky.</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p><strong>Happily, the answer may be more intuitive and attainable than you’d expect – and it can be broken down into 3 steps:</strong></p>
  <ol start="""" role=""list"">
   <li>Design a behavioral blueprint your leaders can follow to drive team-wide engagement and achieve goals<br></li>
   <li>Collect frequent feedback from their direct reports, peers, and managers on how well they exhibit those behaviors<br></li>
   <li>Measure the degree to which their alignment to that behavioral blueprint influences their team’s engagement and productivity</li>
  </ol>
  <p>‍</p>
  <h2>Step 1: Design a behavioral blueprint.</h2>
  <p>Your leaders need to know precisely which behaviors to emulate every day on the job. Sure, plenty of articles talk through the ~10 leadership habits that drive engagement and productivity – but how many of them break those habits down into the behaviors that comprise them?</p>
  <p>For instance – ‘Building Trust’ is a common leadership habit that is known to drive engagement. But if you told your leaders “all you have to do is build trust with your direct reports”, would they know how to do that?</p>
  <h4>‍</h4>
  <h2>Step 2: Collect frequent, anonymous feedback from their closest coworkers on how closely they’re aligning to that blueprint.<br></h2>
  <p>Once you’ve communicated your expectations and how they tie in to the goals of the company, make your expectations ‘real’ by collecting anonymous feedback on how frequently the leaders reflect those behaviors.</p>
  <p>Ask their feedback providers to tell you how frequently they observe their leaders exhibiting a specific behavior.</p>
  <p>In this example, the <a href=""https://www.rhabitanalytics.com/post/hrchat-interview-results-through-employee-feedback"">feedback</a> provider would be asked how frequently over the past 2 weeks Michael Holland has let others do their jobs without micro-managing them.</p>
  <p>Of course, we’d love for you to use Rhabit to do this – it’s what we built our entire company around. </p>
  <p>If you don’t, but you still want to try out frequent feedback, here are some key traits you should focus on.</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <figure class=""w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"">
   <div>
    <img src=""https://cdn.humareso.com/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/615e08f8fc604309ceae3404_Screen%20Shot%202021-10-06%20at%204_36_53%20PM.png"" alt="""">
   </div>
  </figure>
  <p>‍</p>
  <h2>Step 3: Measure the degree to which your leaders are aligned to their behavioral blueprints.</h2>
  <p>Once you’ve collected a few weeks’ worth of objective feedback data, take some time to understand the overall landscape of your leaders’ behaviors, and whether there are individual or systemic problems.</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <figure class=""w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"">
   <div>
    <img src=""https://cdn.humareso.com/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/615e09356ca4c959d0eb4828_Screen%20Shot%202021-10-06%20at%204_36_01%20PM.png"" alt="""">
   </div>
  </figure>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>In the above image, we can see that “Building Trust” is the lowest rated leadership habit for your leaders. Is it a problem for all of your leaders, or are there a couple of leaders pulling down an otherwise healthy score?</p>
  <figure class=""w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"">
   <div>
    <img src=""https://cdn.humareso.com/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/615e095af36a328c1eba8093_Screen%20Shot%202021-10-06%20at%204_36_23%20PM.png"" alt="""">
   </div>
  </figure>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>By breaking down the feedback data for each habit by leader, we can see that most leaders are strong in Building Trust, but Michael Holland is struggling a bit in this area.</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <figure class=""w-richtext-align-floatright w-richtext-figure-type-image"">
   <div>
    <img src=""https://cdn.humareso.com/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/615e09ca19a959717bcb8e3c_Screen%20Shot%202021-10-06%20at%204_39_35%20PM.png"" alt="""">
   </div>
  </figure>
  <p>By collecting feedback on specific leadership behaviors, you can see precisely which behaviors related to ‘Building Trust’ are strong for Michael, and that there are two that need some focus.</p>
  <p>At this point, you can run an intervention for this habit to share with Michael what you’ve learned, how he can improve, and whether there are courses on the subject you might recommend.</p>
  <p>By collecting feedback <strong>frequently</strong>, you can see how Michael’s feedback changes over time as he tries new methods to build trust.</p>
  <p>Ideally, he’ll have access to his own behavioral deep dives and data over time, so that he feels equally in control of his own development.</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>Behavioral blueprints and continuous employee feedback help company leaders do what they’ve never been able to do – have visibility into and control over the behaviors impacting their organizations.</p>

  <h2>Your executive leadership has just unveiled the company's new strategic direction.</h2>
  <p>Of the million things that have just been added to your to-do list, one emerges: </p>
  <p><strong>Activate the workforce.</strong></p>
  <p>This usually involves communicating the new initiative, holding several Town Halls across locations and timezones, outlining what the new initiative is, its value, and what everyone will need to do to achieve the new goal.</p>
  <p>Great. Now what?</p>
  <h2>New objectives call for new behaviors.</h2>
  <p>What will the new objective require of your employees? Their managers? Executive leadership?</p>
  <p>What will they need from the <em>company</em> in order to succeed?</p>
  <p>Let’s imagine the new goal will require a significant focus on being <strong>innovative</strong>.</p>
  <p>Bringing new ideas to bear to help the company diversify its offerings and increase its market competitiveness.</p>
  <p>To change employee behaviors and inspire innovation, you’ll need to design <a href=""http://rhabitanalytics.com/leadership-behaviors"">leadership competencies</a> (at Rhabit we call them habits). What would a leader habit look like for <strong>Innovation?</strong></p>
  <h2>Example leadership behaviors for Innovation</h2>
  <ul role=""list"">
   <li>Come up with big or small ideas that improve current processes or procedures.</li>
   <li>Suggest new ideas on how to improve current processes.</li>
   <li>Try out new solutions that could improve an existing process.</li>
   <li>Improve business processes by finding novel or innovative solutions.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>What would you add to this list? How else might an employee change their behaviors to demonstrate that they are leaning in to the company’s goal of innovation?</p>
  <h2>Consider how leader habits should differ across career levels, and from an engagement perspective.</h2>
  <h3>Managers should...</h3>
  <ul role=""list"">
   <li>Invite teammates to share new ideas, even if the idea isn’t fully fleshed out yet.</li>
   <li>Create an environment where teammates feel comfortable voicing new ideas.</li>
   <li>Encourage brainstorming sessions with teammates of other disciplines to generate new ideas.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Executives should...</h3>
  <ul role=""list"">
   <li>Communicate an ongoing commitment to innovation.</li>
   <li>Allocate sufficient resources to support innovation.</li>
   <li>Communicate the value of innovation.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>The company should...</h3>
  <ul role=""list"">
   <li>Support innovation with both communication and action.</li>
   <li>Reward those who innovate.</li>
   <li>Help employees feel comfortable sharing innovative ideas.</li>
   <li>Frequently discuss new ways to be innovative.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Next, operationalize your new target behaviors with accountability and measurement.</h2>
  <p>You’ll need a measurement process that illuminates the degree to which employees are changing their behaviors to align to the company’s new goals.<br><br></p>
  <p>Classic standbys like traditional 360 assessments and engagement surveys can be helpful, but lightweight <a href=""http://rhabitanalytics.com/solutions"">frequent feedback</a> tools capture more data more frequently and can illustrate whether behaviors are changing over time.<br><br></p>
  <p>The feedback data will also provide you with information of how the behavior change is <a href=""https://www.rhabitanalytics.com/post/what-if-we-took-hr-out-performance-management"">impacting the business.</a><br><br></p>
  <p>Check in frequently on your behavioral measurement to understand which behaviors are practiced frequently, plan for interventions, and iterate new behavior blueprints based on the changing needs of the new direction.</p>
  <h2>Remember - observable behavior change and measurement is key.</h2>
  <p>Your teams will develop new habits faster and more effectively with intuitive behavioral blueprints and frequent feedback. Ideally, the feedback process you employ will be easy, frequent, accessible, and psychologically safe. Doing this will help you operationalize faster behavior change – and communicate its impact on the business – for every employee at your organization.<br><br></p>

  <h1>5 reasons why L&amp;D needs to replace the 360</h1>
  <p>The 360 has become an ever present component of every leadership development program. However, in a time where feedback is a business imperative, we would offer the suggestion that the classic 360 assessment is insufficient as a solution to drive hire performance and develop more capable leaders in the modern work setting.</p>
  <p><br>As shared by several fortune 500 talent executives in our recent webinar “<a href=""https://us02web.zoom.us/rec/share/u3mpWy8fJAIXaNcp2ra0q3uV0nYZMIBX8bhGWPQDtV3Jua7Pqf_tLwWoKddOsLZ4.Gm0RA2yH9zDRrHz-"">Reinventing the 360</a>”, talent leaders agree there are still many flaws with the 360. It is often difficult to get full participation and apply action to the results. A leader may participate in a 360 once in their career, twice if they are lucky. 360 feedback can be useful at that moment, but the developmental needs of the leader will likely change in less than 6 months.<br><br>While the 360 will always be a part of every leadership development program, we propose that a continuous feedback experience creates more opportunities for a robust talent management program.</p>
  <p><br></p>
  <h2>So why should L&amp;D replace the 360 with continuous feedback in 2022?&nbsp;</h2>
  <p><br></p>
  <ol role=""list"">
   <li><strong>360 assessment results age quickly</strong><br>The 360 only reflects a snapshot in time of a leader’s behavior. As we’ve learned over the past few years, change is the only constant. For feedback to be effective and actionable, it needs to paint a complete picture of one’s behaviors over time, not once every few years. Once leaders receive results, there are few opportunities for additional feedback to understand if they are improving, or if they need additional development. <br><br>Takeaway: Frequent, smaller surveys allow for talent managers to collect more data points about a leader’s behavior. This creates a clearer understanding of how a leader performs before, during, and after any intervention. Leaders need ongoing self-awareness and accountability.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <ol start=""2"" role=""list"">
   <li><strong>The is 360 isn’t equitable<br></strong><br>As <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-schwall"">Alexander Schwall, Ph.D.</a> says “Feedback is a gift”. <br><br>Everyone wants feedback, but due to budget constraints, 360s are often gated to a specific population of existing leaders (think VPs, Executives, C-Suite). The incoming generations of leaders expect regular meaningful feedback but may have to wait years to get the same quality of feedback as their managers. Unless feedback programs are deployed equitably across all employees, high potentials will go unrecognized, and development opportunities will be missed. This leads to regrettable loss and turnover.<br><br>Takeaway: Continuous feedback is easy to deploy at all levels of any organization to give everyone the same exposure to feedback and accountability. Retention rates increase when all employees are given access to regular, productive feedback. <br><br></li>
   <li><strong>360s are exhausting</strong><br>Participating in a 360 often requires a leader to dedicate time and attention to filling out forms. For some leaders, this may take several hours or more out of their tight schedules and be perceived as a burden.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><br>One of the top concerns voiced by the audience in Rhabit’s 360 webinar was how difficult it is to get participants to hit their deadlines to submit their feedback. Survey fatigue means missed deadlines, and can lead to incomplete submissions. If feedback is incomplete, or even worse dishonest, the program can do more harm than good.&nbsp;</p>
  <p><br>Takeaway: Repackaging 360s from long, time-consuming forms to frequent and small pieces of feedback increases participation. Create a way for 360 feedback to be a regular part of one’s routine rather than an event that requires time out of one’s schedule. <br><br><br></p>
  <ol start=""4"" role=""list"">
   <li><strong>The 360 is a point in time event<br></strong>When was the last time you participated in a 360, if ever? Last year? Three years ago? This is far too infrequent for talent teams to have the right data to make strategic decisions. Worse yet, leaders are often left in the dark unknowing if their behaviors meet the needs of their teams or the business. When feedback is infrequent (think annually or longer) too much time is allowed to pass without opportunity for self-correction or training intervention.<br><br>Takeaway: Point-in-time events are great to establish a baseline, but offer very little for leaders to receive relevant feedback in the short and long term. Continuous feedback, when used alongside a 360, empowers leaders to take control of their behavior and make small, frequent corrections to align with the changing needs of the business. <br><br></li>
   <li><strong>You can’t prove impact with a 360</strong></li>
  </ol>
  <p>360s are a great way to understand a leader’s strengths and weaknesses, and to provide a prescriptive development plan. However, as the leader’s behaviors change and feedback ages, it becomes increasingly difficult to prove impact. The data from a 360 is static, losing its value over time. Talent managers can not measure which leaders improve after these engagements, and which stagnate back to the status quo. <br><br></p>
  <p>Takeaway: Measuring leader behaviors continuously and over time provides evidence of the effectiveness of development programs. L&amp;D can prove out impact by reporting on which investments yield the best results or which should be sunset, making their program more strategic and effective. When feedback is measured continuously through micro-sampling, L&amp;D leaders can prove which development programs had the greatest impact, allowing for ongoing fine-tuning and improvement.</p>

  <h1><strong>The Hows Matter</strong></h1>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>I’ve been on the receiving end of many a performance review in my life.&nbsp; So many wonderful experiences.&nbsp; Man, let me tell you when I think of my most meaningful experiences in my professional career, all my performance reviews are right up there at the top.&nbsp; Nothing better in the world.&nbsp; The awkward sitting down together in a slightly too small for two people office or better yet, in a cavernous and impersonal conference room (bonus points if there’s a basket of dongles within reach).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>The shadow play of the forced ceremony of looking back at what’s been done in the past year, as if either myself or my manager had any real clarity of what transpired even in the last quarter, let alone 11 months ago.&nbsp; <strong>That beautiful poignant moment where my manager has to contrive something I can improve on even though I’m being told how amazing a job I’m doing</strong> so that on the off chance this conversation is positive that we can make sure there’s at least a little bit of negative emotionality that can get in there to make sure no one’s having too much of a good time.&nbsp; What an absolute circus.&nbsp;</p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>The things that killed me then are the things that absolutely kill me now - so many of these performance management conversations are laser-focused on the “what” you’ve done.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>The metrics, the OKRs, the KPIs, the deals closed, etc.&nbsp; Even if there’s a conversation around “how” you’re working to achieve your outcomes, it’s exceedingly rare that it’s actually recorded.&nbsp; The artifact that the processes typically produce for the business is documentation strictly of the “what” variety.&nbsp; Whether or not how you got to these outcomes is sustainable, aligned with the desired culture of the business, or even just a reasonable rational expectation of human interaction is completely absent in the data, and this is what I believe is one of the fundamental places where the work culture of a company can start to collapse.&nbsp;</p>
  <p><br></p>
  <h1><strong>Performance Management is a critical part of a company’s infrastructure</strong></h1>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>We started <a href=""https://www.rhabitanalytics.com/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=hows"">Rhabit</a> in Pittsburgh originally, many of the team still call it home, but lots of us are distributed now in the post-pandemic world.&nbsp; A month or so ago, there was a story about a bridge many of us who worked at Rhabit have crossed at some point in our time at Pittsburgh completely collapsing.&nbsp; It was a big deal, probably a bigger deal than the Sink Hole that swallowed a bus downtown, but that’s another infrastructure failure story for another time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>

    A major bridge collapse in Pittsburgh
   </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>The bridge that collapsed didn’t just up and fall over suddenly.&nbsp; It had been inspected regularly and rated with a poor grade for years before collapsing.&nbsp; I’m not setting up this perhaps contrived allegory to talk about how you should invest in maintaining your employees (you should, there’s <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbooksauthors/2020/05/19/why-investing-in-your-employees-pays-off/"">great data</a> to support that’s a good thing), but to rather talk about what made that bridge collapse.</p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>It was a slow decay.&nbsp; The earth around the bridge eroded over years.&nbsp; The materials the bridge was built with broke down in the heat of the summer and the brutal rain and cold of the winters.&nbsp; The disintegration was a slow one, and I think that running a performance review process that doesn’t explicitly record the data around “how” people go about working with others on the way to delivering the metrics that matter is precisely how you collapse a company.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p><br></p>
  <h1><strong>Behaviors are the backbone of the “how”.&nbsp;</strong></h1>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>The behaviors that erode the culture, that breed toxicity, that foster attrition, they seep in over time, not because someone is out there telling people to behave this way, but because they’re passively supported.&nbsp; That passiveness is enabled by the fact that there’s simply no process to transparently record the observation of the behavior of employees and there’s no standardized accountability around it (which is reasonable if there’s no data).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>This is the reason why when our customers talk to us about their work culture and how they’re looking to change it, we’re always asking questions about the performance management process and <em>what </em>they’re measuring and <em>how</em> they’re measuring it.&nbsp; People often do light up with this sudden realization at the novelty of including some level of measurement of interpersonal behavior in their PM process.&nbsp; It’s a no-brainer.&nbsp;</p>
  <p><br></p>
  <blockquote>
   If you want to change a world culture, you have to change behavior, and if you want to change behavior you first have to measure the behavior and hold people accountable to the results of that measurement.&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </blockquote>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>That’s the power of the “How” after all.&nbsp; The “Whats” are necessary for the business to survive, grow, and find success in the market, but they aren’t sufficient.&nbsp; True high performance companies always have stories of where the “Hows” paired with the “Whats” to really differentiate them and drive their growth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p><br></p>
  <h1><strong>Don’t leave peak Performance Management to luck</strong></h1>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>Some of these companies when you ask them exactly what they did to do this, will openly admit that it was just luck.&nbsp; They put smart folks together, the time was right in the market, magic happened and <em>poof </em>- huge success.&nbsp; I’d like to think that most executives are aware that luck plays a part of the game, but there are definitely ways to improve your odds of success.&nbsp;</p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>There is significant evidence to suggest that if you commit to making the “how” work gets done a key part of the employee performance evaluation at your company, you’ve got a better chance of sustained long term success than a singular focus on “what” people are producing. We’ve pushed ourselves at Rhabit to build <a href=""https://www.rhabitanalytics.com/solutions/solutions?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=hows"">elegant tools</a> for this because it’s an easier thing to talk about than it is to execute, but we’ve seen first hand over the years that it’s 1) possible and 2) <strong>it really does have a real, visceral impact on the work culture</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>If you’d like to learn about new approaches to performance management and tools that can help your company deliver a process that focuses on the “hows” and “whats” more equitably, we’d love a chance to talk with you. <a href=""https://www.rhabitanalytics.com/request-demo?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=hows"">Book some time today</a>, and we’ll get you the tools you need to get started.<br></p>

  <h1>Go ahead, waste a little time</h1>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>Remote work has changed the way we work as companies forever. The effects of our sudden and large scale shift to remote and <a href=""/post/leading-remote-teams-leadership-habits-that-work-from-a-distance"">distributed teams</a> surely aren’t fully understood yet. We’ll be sorting out the long term effects and changes this phenomenon has caused in our society for decades to come. There’s so much you can tease apart in its sociocultural impact alone, it’s simply fascinating.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>There’s one element specifically I’d like to zero in on for this week's blog. It’s around the communication behaviors in managers, and I think it’s something that’s become very fundamental in successfully managing the performance of a distributed team.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>What I want to talk about is intentionality.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <h2><strong>The old office is never coming back, it’s time to adapt</strong></h2>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>In the office setting, there’s often these informal mechanisms that contribute to good communication and the sharing of information. There’s things like shared meals, interoffice transit, communal space (break rooms, restrooms, conference rooms etc) - all these places where the reason you’re there may be something totally unrelated, but what you end up doing is sharing information and knowledge with the people you work with.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>Switching over to the remote setting, you lose all of this immediately. There’s no shared space, and in a video conference there’s no way to even have a side conversation on the periphery of the formal meeting experience. As a manager, what’s effectively happening is you’re losing opportunities to share information, to be observed, and to reinforce culture.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>This loss is a pretty significant one, and I think it’s a key element of the general feeling that when employees go remote, the first thing that enters in the mind of the leadership is fear, fear of lost productivity stemming from the loss of control. That control being all those shared moments in physical proximity in both formal and informal interactions, to communicate, to be observed, and again to reinforce the work culture.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>As soon as we enter the land of Slack (or Teams if you’re truly cursed), Emails, Zoom, and everything else asynchronous, we have to change some of our fundamental behaviors in order to adapt as leaders.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <h2><strong>The secret is intentionality</strong></h2>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>When Rhabit went fully distributed in March of 2020, we like many fumbled our way through how to adjust to this. As of today, I can say that I’ve learned (and am still learning) a great deal about working with a team in a distributed environment, and one thing I feel like we have very, very strong evidence through either the data coming through our platform, through my conversations with users, peers, and other leaders, as well as my own direct experience over what’s just hit a 2 year mark, is that intentionality is quintessential to successful remote leadership.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <blockquote>
   “When I say intentionality, I mean that you absolutely cannot, under any circumstances, rely on formal processes to trigger communication with employees nor can you rely on the employees themselves to bring things up with you. You have to be 
   <em>intentional</em>.”
  </blockquote>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>You’re best served as a manager on a remote team, in your idle time, to occasionally send out a direct message to each of your team members asking how they’re doing. Yes you should <a href=""/performance-management"">schedule 1:1s</a>, yes you should show up to them, yes they should have structure - all these things are good, but you should also make it a point to periodically be purposeful about interacting with your team on an individual level - and here’s the catch - you have have to do this completely devoid of a productive work context. I know, crazy right?&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>You have to purposefully NOT dig into work topics, because what you need to do is build trust and rapport. Could you do this in a work context? Absolutely, but in the work context the power balance still clearly exists. If you’re having a more casual conversation that’s outside of that context, you’re yielding power, which in this case I genuinely believe is a good thing. You’re making it safe to get to know you as a person, to build some comfort with you interpersonally, and to not feel like the fundamental purpose you serve is to monitor their work and push them to perpetually do more faster with less resources.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <h2><strong>Go ahead, waste some time</strong></h2>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>I’m telling you to be intentional and “waste” (<em>it’s unequivocally not a waste</em>) a little time bullshitting around. Give away a little of that productivity in the short term for longer term gains of having employees who trust you and are comfortable sharing things with you. In the office, these kinds of things just sort of happen.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>I’ve dawdled around the hallways with some of the smartest, most effective leaders I’ve ever worked for and it served as wonderful interactions that fostered trust and mutual respect - but that’s gone now. No use crying over the loss, we have to adjust and move on, and the adjustment here is intentionally reaching out over slack, doing an ad-hoc zoom call, coordinating a walk-n-talk over the phone, purposefully making the explicit decision to <a href=""/post/set-goals-to-be-around-your-people"">spend time with your employees</a> interacting with them without an agenda as a way to build the report that’s no longer baked into the work experience.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p><strong>This is the new normal of the distributed team.&nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>Make intentional time to get to know your teammates, to listen to them, to give them moments to share, and don’t wait for them to come to you. This is something the leader owns. You’re accountable for the health of the communication within your team, and the only way you can ensure that you’re effectively communicating with folks in a remote setting is to intentionally connect with them.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Do yourself a favor, if you’ve read this piece, and you’re a leader, do some quick mental math and figure out when the last time you had a relaxed, casual interaction for more than 5 minutes with each of your teammates. Anyone who's outside of a couple of weeks of having one of those, <strong>go grab some time with them right now</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Great rapport between you and your employees doesn’t just magically manifest from the ether, you have to work at it and be intentional about its growth, so go be intentional about “wasting a little time” with your folks.</p>

Perhaps it was you standing there feeling the anxiety of others being scooped up to a team while you hang out there in social purgatory. It’s a recipe for a core memory that you’d prefer not to have.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Fast forward 15-20 years and here we are at the workplace. Kickball teams are still being picked. It may not be as formal or as obvious as recess protocols, but sides are picked, nonetheless. We want to believe that we’ve moved on from that. We want to believe that we are grown up and that we treat people better. And here we are with <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrobinson/2024/03/27/anxiety-skyrockets-to-no-1-issue-among-american-workers-new-study-shows/"">anxiety</a> as the top issue workers are facing.</p>
<p>It is totally understandable that some of the anxiety is unavoidable. Job performance metrics tied to compensation or promotion, difficult clients or customers, grueling industries that operate seven days a week…these factors and more can cause a fair bit of stress and anxiety. An organization cannot apologize for these truths (unless it’s causing them!) but rather work transparently to inform those interested in coming into the company or moving forward with it as to what the realities are. Then, those candidates/employees can assess their capability to handle such stress.</p>
<p>But what happens when the organization itself is the direct cause of anxiety? I mean, we’ve heard of those places. Maybe you’ve even worked in those places. In the movie, <strong>Wanted</strong>, James McAvoy’s character, Wesley, deals with deep stress and has a frustratingly anxious life at work. Between Janice and Barry, Wesley finds himself sick and at a crossroads. Now, while we could never condone verbally lashing out and physical violence at work, we do find ourselves cheering Wesley on as he tells Janice where to go and smacks Barry (Chris Pratt) with a face full of keyboard. Scenes like this resonate with us because we have either been through hell at a workplace or, at least, have observed others dealing with it.</p>
<p>And lest you think anxiety is down due to those jobs that can work exclusively from home or elsewhere, online bullying and taunting is as high as it’s ever been. Communication channels like Slack and Teams are filled with “private” chats and groups that passively address those employees “not pulling their weight” or who don’t show themselves to be a “team player” or “good fit.” Those talked-about employees have a sense it’s happening, even if they don’t have the screenshots to prove it. Staff who think they are getting away with it, or worse, couch it as “I don’t want to hurt their feelings,” should know that those feelings are already tenuous at best.</p>
<p>Anxiety can be clinical in diagnosis so be wary about overreaching in our Dr. Phil world. Staff moonlighting as psychiatrists or therapists should take a seat and be silent. Most are not trained to know how deep the stress-related response goes so to treat it trivially with an “oh, come on, it’s not too bad” motivating quip could cause more damage.</p>
<p>If your organization has an EAP, be sure to have those offerings shared, reshared, posted and reposted. You don’t know the day when that support will be just what an employee needs to see. If you are not large enough to have a carrier-supported EAP, use your local 211 or 988 hotline offerings for similar sharing. Accordingly to the <a href=""https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2016/article/suicide-in-the-workplace.htm"">BLS</a>, approximately 20% of all workplace deaths of those 35 to 64 years of age are by suicide. That’s one in five. That number ought to show us the level and consistency of support needed.</p>
<p>Take seriously, too, those employees who share and show signs of anxiety and deep stress. When an employee is brave enough to verbally share such a state, it ought to be met with support. It should not be met merely with well wishes but activated resources.</p>
<p>Work with your leadership for a common approach to stress and anxiety in the workplace. There should be a known process for those in management – what should they do when they hear about or observe anxiety in staff? Reactive-only help does offer a level of support, but it is incomplete; at times, too much time has elapsed. The reality of stress should be met with proactive access to helpful resources. And those kickball-like constructs at the workplace need to be demolished before recess is over.</p>

"Humareso Blog","Catch My Breath","Catch My Breath","en","https://blog.humareso.com/catch-my-breath","John Baldino","","Learning management is a career-long journey. Education in human resources and its related work if vital to growth","2024-07-05 14:53:10","2024-08-16T05:57:49.023Z","<p><img src=""https://cdn.humareso.com/hubfs/Humareso%20Blog%20Posts-8-Catch%20My%20Breath.jpeg"" width=""2400"" height=""1280"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Humareso Blog Posts-8-Catch My Breath"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 2400px;"">After being at #SHRM24 last week, I needed a minute to catch my breath. I got to hang with 26,000 of my closest friends in Chicago where we learned, connected, laughed and jammed out to Kelly Clarkson. The vibe was energizing. To be honest, it is surprising to see this many people gathering for the <a href=""https://annual.shrm.org/"">annual conference</a> while breaking records year over year. It speaks to the need for engaging education and professional networking for practitioners across the globe.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>We are meant to be hungry for more. We need to deepen our knowledge of compliance. We are to be challenged in talent strategies. We are to advance our understanding of workforce planning, organizational design and technological breakthroughs. We are to be stronger in these areas and more.</p>
<p>At any one breakout session block, there were no less than 25 options to meet practitioners where they are. Some sessions were transformatively advanced; some were tactically relevant. It is in a moment like this that we need to let people know it is okay to start where they are. We ought to be letting those emerging practitioners know it is understandable to not to know as much as we might assume they do. Truth be told, we may also need to speak similarly to those mid-level professionals. It’s not unusual for someone with five years of experience to miss what some of us may consider “the basics.”</p>
<p>Cultivating learning within our own discipline is a responsibility for all. Even if you are brand new to the work, you can be a champion for learning and encourage others around you to join in. Because of you and your efforts, you will likely foster a groundswell in your companies and in your local associations for continuing education. Be a leader for learning and find places where it happens.</p>
<p>The webinar circuit has been the strongest over these last few years. The pandemic pushed these online learning opportunities to the forefront of accessibility without compromising the areas of depth covered. And to do so with others made the learning better. The collaboration deepened understanding as well as the practice of the content delivered. We laid aside the Miss Independent or Mr. Know-It-All natures that many in the industry had in favor of an innovative group approach. We became each other’s cheerleaders for learning and practicing.</p>
<p>Events like last week are meant to foster our passion for education. It’s not too late. You are not already gone. Whether it’s your second year in human resources or it’s your thirty-second year, I dare you to reignite the fire of learning.</p>

 <div class=""w-richtext"">
  <p>Your managers have the largest impact on your organization's bottom line, but many managers are promoted based on tenure or their skills in their individual contributor roles. This often leads to managers who ascend through the organization without having developed the key behaviors of a successful lead.</p>
  <p>High-performing organizations are increasingly turning to leadership development programs to cultivate effective leaders who can inspire, motivate, and drive results. &nbsp;However, the true power of these programs lies in their foundation: a successful assessment process.</p>
  <p><strong>Why Assessment Matters</strong></p>
  <p>Leadership assessments provide valuable insights into an individual's strengths, weaknesses, and leadership style. &nbsp;This data allows for targeted development, ensuring leaders receive the training and support they need to address specific areas for growth. &nbsp;A study by DDI found that companies with strong formal assessment programs were able to fill 56% of critical leadership roles internally, compared to only 43% for companies without such programs.</p>
  <p>Historically assessments have been reserved for senior leaders, potentially exposing leaders to 360 feedback only once or twice in their careers. Until recently assessments only reveal feedback results for a single point in time, and were incredibly time consuming and difficult to parse through, with little follow up to measure for behavior change. Furthermore, this cumbersome process typically required bringing in external consultants that are costly and not necessarily effective.</p>
  <p><strong>The Impact of Effective Leadership</strong></p>
  <p>Developing leaders who exhibit key behaviors like trust, accountability, and coaching can have a profound impact on a company's bottom line. &nbsp;Here's how:</p>
  <ul role=""list"">
   <li><strong>Increased Employee Retention:</strong> &nbsp;A <a href=""https://www.rhabitanalytics.com/post/what-is-driving-your-employees-away"">study by Rhabit</a> found that employees who report having a great manager are five times more likely to stay with their organization. &nbsp;Leaders who build trust and foster a sense of accountability create a more positive work environment, reducing turnover and its associated costs.</li>
   <li><strong>High Performing Teams:</strong> &nbsp;Research by Zenger Folkman revealed that teams led by strong coaches experience a 50% increase in productivity. &nbsp; Effective coaching empowers employees, fosters collaboration, and unlocks their full potential.</li>
   <li><strong>Developing High Performers:</strong> &nbsp;Leaders who prioritize coaching and development create a culture of continuous learning. &nbsp;Organizations with strong leadership development programs have 21% more high potential employees. &nbsp;By investing in their people, leaders build a pipeline of future talent.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>The Assessment Advantage</strong></p>
  <p>The success of leadership development hinges on a <a href=""/assessments"">well-designed assessment</a> process. &nbsp;By identifying the specific needs of each leader, organizations can create personalized development plans that address their unique strengths and weaknesses. &nbsp;This targeted approach ensures leaders receive the most impactful training, maximizing their return on investment.</p>
  <p><strong>Beyond the Assessment: The Power of Real-Time Feedback</strong></p>
  <p>While a strong assessment is the first step, true leadership development requires ongoing coaching and&nbsp;feedback, revealing learning transfer and behavior change. This is where real-time feedback in Rhabit becomes the most effective solution for organizations seeking long term leader behavior change. &nbsp;Platforms like Rhabit Analytics provide leaders with access to personalized dashboards that deliver data-driven insights into their leadership behaviors. &nbsp; This constant feedback loop allows leaders to:</p>
  <ul role=""list"">
   <li><strong>Increase Self-Awareness:</strong> &nbsp;By seeing their leadership style quantified, leaders gain a deeper understanding of their strengths and areas for improvement.</li>
   <li><strong>Take Ownership of Development:</strong> &nbsp;Real-time data empowers leaders to feel in control of their own growth journey. &nbsp;They can track progress, experiment with new behaviors, and celebrate successes.</li>
   <li><strong>Make Small, Sustainable Changes:</strong> &nbsp;The beauty of real-time feedback lies in its ability to guide incremental improvements. &nbsp;Leaders can focus on one or two key behaviors at a time, leading to lasting change.</li>
   <li><strong>Drive Higher Feedback Scores Over Time:</strong> &nbsp;As leaders develop their skills and refine their behaviors, they'll naturally receive more positive feedback from colleagues and direct reports. &nbsp;This reinforces positive behaviors and motivates continued growth.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>The Rhabit Advantage</strong></p>
  <p>Rhabit Analytics goes beyond traditional leadership assessments. &nbsp;Our platform offers a complete leadership development solution that combines insightful assessments with real-time feedback and ongoing support. &nbsp;This data-driven approach fosters self-awareness, empowers leaders to take ownership of their development, and guides them towards making sustainable, positive changes. &nbsp;The result? &nbsp;Leaders who are more effective, teams that are more productive, and a business that outperforms the competition.</p>
  <p><strong>Investing in Your Future</strong></p>
  <p>Developing assessed leaders is an investment in the future of your organization. &nbsp;By creating a pipeline of strong, effective leaders, you foster a culture of trust, accountability, and continuous learning. &nbsp;This translates into higher employee retention, high-performing teams, and ultimately, a stronger, more successful business. &nbsp;</p>
  <p>Don't wait – &nbsp;start building your bench of future leaders today. <a href=""/demo"">Schedule a time</a> to meet a Rhabit consultant, or watch our <a href=""/lp/demo-series-registration"">pre-recorded assessments demo</a>. </p>

  <p>Engagement surveys make a simple but big promise: Tell you what your employees are unhappy with. All you need to do is address these issues to fix it.</p>
  <p>But, this promise is rarely kept. Engagement Surveys will tell you if your employees feel and think negatively about your organization but you may not know how to address the underlying issues.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>For example, all of <a href=""/employee-engagement"">our surveys</a> contain a key question:&nbsp; <em>I am unlikely to leave my company in the next 12 months.</em> When agreement on this question drops into the 60% range, our clients wake up. They know they are in hot water and are facing elevated turnover rates. But what can be done? How can this be changed?</p>
  <p>Sure, the first instinct is to check if pay increases are possible, add benefits, offer more wellness, and have more company barbeques.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>While we don’t disagree, we believe that none of these actions get to the root cause.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>To better understand what can be done, the Rhabit consulting team looked across 5 of Rhabit’s clients with a total of 4133 employees and 437 managers. We investigated which manager behaviors drive your employees away.</p>
  <h2>Study design</h2>

  <h3>Predictors</h3>
  <p>We looked at 2 categories of <a href=""/assessments"">leadership behaviors</a>:&nbsp;</p>
  <h2><strong>Getting things done </strong>and <strong>Getting along</strong></h2>
  <h4>Getting things done describes leadership behaviors that hold team members accountable. It is made up of these basic manager behaviors:</h4>
  <ul role=""list"">
   <li>Holds team members accountable.</li>
   <li>Sets clear priorities for team members.</li>
   <li>Gives useful and clear directions.</li>
   <li>Closely tracks the team’s progress.</li>
   <li>Sets clear performance goals for the team</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Getting along is all about building trusting relationships. Leaders who demonstrate these behaviors connect with their employees and are equitable, fair, and trustworthy.</h4>
  <ul role=""list"">
   <li>Keeps commitments and promises.</li>
   <li>Explains goals, objectives, and the reasons for pursuing them.&nbsp;</li>
   <li>Recognizes team members fairly.</li>
   <li>Does not take credit for the work of others.</li>
   <li>Admits mistakes.</li>
   <li>Listens and cares about what others have to say.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>BTW, these two clusters are not coming out of nowhere. The last 70 years of leadership research of again and again found these two categories of behaviors. Sometimes they are called “Production/Employee orientation”, sometimes “Concern for Production/Concern for people”, or “Directive Leadership/Supportive Leadership”. However, under the hood, these categories all describe the same thing: getting things done and getting along.”</p>
  <h3>Outcome Measures</h3>
  <p>As an outcome, we measured the turnover intentions for each one of the 4137 employees in this study. In other words, are they ready to quit or thinking about quitting?&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>Findings (the not surprising ones)</h3>
  <figure style=""max-width: 20%"" class=""w-richtext-align-floatleft w-richtext-figure-type-image"">
   <div>
    <img src=""https://cdn.humareso.com/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/66588f07af6e1339cec1ce1b_Screen%20Shot%202024-05-30%20at%2010_33_16%20AM.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt="""">
   </div>
  </figure>
  <p>Here are the not-so-surprising findings: Managers who show “Getting Along” behaviors are better at retaining their employees. Being a kind, friendly, and trustworthy leader will help you keep employees. Clearly, anyone who ever had a boss could have predicted this. However, this doesn’t mean that managers are getting this right. They do take credit for other’s work, they don’t recognize others fairly and they definitely don’t listen to their team. It happens all the time.</p>
  <p>What are the effects?</p>
  <p>In teams with leaders who show these behaviors, <strong>employees are 2 to 5 times LESS likely to have turnover intentions</strong>. They are also 2-5 times more likely to recommend employment at this company.</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <h3>Findings (the surprising ones)</h3>
  <figure style=""max-width: 20%"" class=""w-richtext-align-floatleft w-richtext-figure-type-image"">
   <div>
    <img src=""https://cdn.humareso.com/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/66588f52b0d631a12e468870_Screen%20Shot%202024-05-30%20at%2010_33_27%20AM.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt="""">
   </div>
  </figure>
  <p>Managers who show “Getting things done” behaviors are high-accountability leaders, who set goals, set priorities, and track performance. They have an eye on productivity. <strong>In other words, they hold their employee </strong><a href=""/build-a-performance-culture-leadership-behaviors""><strong>accountable for their performance</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Who wants to work for someone like that? We were, frankly, not sure if this behavior would keep employees or drive them away.</p>
  <p>However, our results were very clear. Getting things done behaviors drive retention.&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>In teams with high accountability managers, employees are 3 to 8 times LESS likely to have turnover intentions.</strong></p>
  <p>Why is this the case? We did a follow-up study. We found that high-performing employees are particularly affected by high accountability leaders. They appreciate a high-accountability leader more than low performers. And this makes sense. In a low-accountability team, everybody is treated the same. Low-performers get away with performing poorly while high-performers will not feel treated special. They don’t get any additional recognition.</p>
  <p>In this environment, your high performers will likely leave the organization because why should they stay? Their extra effort and their talent are not being recognized and they are getting the same as their low-performing colleagues. In a situation like this, <em>a LinkedIn message from a recruiter will find fertile ground.</em>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>We know what makes a good leader: Being relatable and ensuring that extra efforts are recognized. Good managers can juggle these two demands. If managers fail to do so your company is at risk of losing high performers while successfully hanging on to the mediocre ones.</p>
  <p>If you have a <a href=""/webinar-engagement-retention"">retention</a> problem, the first place to look is your leaders. Leadership skills can be trained. Coaching engagement can target specific leaders, and leadership development classes can efficiently upskill your entire management staff. The key is not to stop with an engagement survey but to address the issue at its root cause, your leaders.</p>

With businesses owing trillions in debt though credit lines, leveraged financing, SBA lending and more, the flexibility in simply adding 3-6% to compensation becomes more difficult to guarantee.</p>
<!--more--><p>There are a few ways for additional monies to be secured. Again, the route of credit expansion remains the most popular. Adding debt to an already encumbered business, with small businesses (100 or less employees) averaging over $650,000 in <a href=""https://www.creditsuite.com/blog/small-business-lending-statistics-and-trends/#:~:text=Average%20Debt%20Held%20by%20the%20Average%20Small%20Business&amp;text=Per%20Bankrate%2C%20the%20average%20SBA,fluctuates%20year%2Dto%2Dyear."">SBA loans</a>, has proven to be difficult in this recessionary environment. With almost <a href=""https://stachecow.com/how-many-us-businesses-open-and-close-every-year-309"">600,000 businesses closing</a> each year, bankruptcy lingers for years with these business owners. For those publicly traded companies, shareholder and board influence continues to offset debt with massive layoffs, by percentage. Debt is being managed and may not allow for additional extensions by current creditors.</p>
<p>We are also seeing a hike in the costs of goods and services. What once was a Denny’s Grand Slam breakfast for $3.99 now sells for $32 in some establishments (with many Denny’s shuttered). Curtailed consumerism is happening is a variety of B2C environments; just look at the number of retail and restaurant closures in the news lately. Some hospital systems in larger metropolitan areas have merged, allowing for the closure of some facilities, cutting back on physical plant and staffing costs (even unbridled hospital billing is hitting a threshold in some markets) Manufacturing facilities have gone from three shifts to two in response to reduced inventory demands. This is not true for all manufacturing or distribution organizations, but it is worth noting the ripple effect of rising prices.</p>
<p>As managers, executive leaders and human resources practitioners, we must work hard to work within constructs. What are our limited resources? How do we best support the needs of our talent and handle the fiscal responsibilities of the organization? There is no silver bullet.</p>
<p>Having spent time with compensation experts this past week, the strain on their “magic” was palpable. While many professionals in human resources have moved on since the pandemic, those who focus on benefits and compensation need to be valued and cultivated. There are not many running to become the next compensation expert. Our compensation staff are not magicians – math can only math so much.</p>
<p>When is the last time your team has had a real discussion about compensation strategy? Have you talked through pay for performance and merit-based systems? Do you have the people analytics to help support a position? What about pay equity? Is it a nice idea of one that is being addressed? What is happening with talent acquisition and pay bands? Are you competitive in pay and are you researching those benchmarks? These questions will likely have multiple sub-questions. It’s a process.</p>
<p>Cash is king in a world of debt. How financially sound are the decisions for compensation in your organizations? And is there data to support it? Getting money from Finance for your budgeted increase is not easy, and it should be a metrics-based process. There is money, to be sure, but where it is and how it is to be used is where we come in. Let’s build and affirm comp structures.</p>

  <p>The world of human resources management consulting is a competitive landscape. Clients, increasingly sophisticated in their understanding of <a href=""/post/why-leadership-assessments-fail"">leadership development</a>, demand not just insightful recommendations but demonstrably improved outcomes. This shift necessitates a data-driven approach, one that bridges the gap between theoretical frameworks and tangible business results.&nbsp;</p>
  <h1>Here, we explore 3 key ways consultants can leverage new technology to supercharge their client offerings and solidify their positions as trusted advisors:</h1>
  <h2>1. Bridging the Learning Gap: Continuous Assessment and Tailored Interventions</h2>
  <p>Management consultants meticulously craft development programs, filled with strategies and exercises designed to propel leaders to new heights. However, a crucial question often remains: are these newly acquired skills translating into lasting behavior change and demonstrably improved business performance? Traditional one-time evaluations often paint an incomplete picture. This is where innovative technology providers like Rhabit come in.</p>
  <p>Rhabit specializes in leadership development analytics, offering a game-changing solution – continuous l<a href=""/assessments"">eadership assessments</a>. Unlike traditional assessments, Rhabit provides ongoing feedback through 360-degree surveys. Imagine having a personalized progress report for each leader you work with, allowing you to track their development journey over time. This longitudinal data empowers you to identify areas where leaders are excelling, pinpoint lingering challenges, and tailor your interventions accordingly.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, Rhabit's robust dashboards go beyond basic reports. They empower leaders to visualize their progress in key areas like communication, delegation, and strategic thinking. This fosters self-awareness and ownership over development, fueling motivation and ensuring leaders remain actively engaged in the learning process.</p>
  <h2>2. Seamless Integration: Personalization, Microlearning, and Accelerated Development</h2>
  <p>Modern technology can bridge the frustrating disconnect that often exists between development programs and practical application. Rhabit, for example, seamlessly integrates with your existing learning materials.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This ensures that when a leader needs to delve deeper into a specific area for improvement, relevant training materials are readily available. No more generic training that doesn't address individual needs! Rhabit personalizes the learning experience, accelerating development and ensuring a direct line of sight between training and real-world application.</p>
  <p>Beyond integration, technology allows you to leverage the power of microlearning. Bite-sized, targeted learning modules can be delivered directly to leaders at the point of need. This approach reinforces key concepts, enhances knowledge retention, and caters to the increasingly busy schedules of today's leaders.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Imagine the impact of delivering a just-in-time microlearning module on delegation right before a leader is tasked with managing a large project.</p>
  <h1>3. Building Stronger Client Relationships and Sustainable Revenue Streams Through Data-Driven Insights</h1>
  <p>By becoming a Rhabit Value Added Reseller (VAR), you're not just adding another platform to your suite of solutions; you're unlocking new avenues for growth. Offering Rhabit's platform as a valuable add-on to your development programs creates a sustainable income stream.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Additionally, leveraging Rhabit’s analytics has a positive impact on client relationships.</p>
  <p>With Rhabit's data-driven insights, you can move beyond simply offering recommendations. You can demonstrate the quantifiable impact your programs are having on client leadership teams and their bottom line.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This data-driven approach fosters trust and transparency, transforming you from an advisor into a trusted partner who delivers results. Happy clients mean long-term partnerships, and that's a recipe for success for everyone involved.</p>
  <h1>The Future of Management Consulting Relies on Partnerships With Technolgy Solutions</h1>
  <p>Embracing technology through strategic partnerships is not just about staying ahead of the curve – it's about creating a win-win situation for consultants, their clients, and the leaders they help develop. By leveraging technology like Rhabit, you can strengthen your service offerings, unlock new revenue streams, and position yourself as a leader in data-driven development.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In today's competitive consulting world, partnering with the right technology empowers you to deliver measurable results and elevate your clients to new heights. </p>

Watch our <a href=""https://www.rhabitanalytics.com/partner-webinar?utm_source=Website&amp;utm_medium=Popup&amp;utm_campaign=partner_webinar"">on-demand webinar</a> on how partnerships with Rhabit can benefit your organization to learn how to get started.</p>

  <h1>Using Rhabit Data to Identify Drivers of Turnover and Turnover Intentions</h1>
  <p>Alexander Schwall, PhD</p>
  <p><em>Chief Science Officer, Rhabit Analytics</em></p>
  <p><strong>This is a condensed version for web. Download and read the entire report </strong><a href=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6131285b34aada254b49c362/66047d93ac49e6f76defa295_Using%20Rhabit%20Data%20To%20Identify%20Drivers%20of%20Turnover%20and%20Turnover%20Intentions.pdf"" target=""_blank""><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
  <h1>Summary</h1>
  <p>The <a href=""/"">Rhabit Analytics</a> team investigated if voluntary turnover of employees can be predicted and potentially prevented. For this study we used the data from a mid-size government consulting organization based in Arlington, VA.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In the first analysis, we looked for relationships between <strong>employee sentiment</strong> and <strong>turnover</strong>.</p>
  <p>We found differences in <a href=""/employee-engagement"">employee sentiment</a> between employees who leave and employees who stay with the consultancy. The employee sentiment items most associated with turnover fall into three broad categories:</p>
  <ul role=""list"">
   <li>Autonomy over work assignments and tasks. Employees who stay with the company are <strong>2.2 to 2.5 times more likely to score high in this sentiment than employees who leave</strong>.</li>
   <li>Professional Growth. <strong>Employees who stay with the company are 3 to 4.6 times more likely to score high in this sentiment than employees who leave</strong>.</li>
   <li>Recognition and Accountability. <strong>Employees who stay with the company are 2 to 2.6 times more likely to score high in this sentiment than employees who leave.</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>It is noteworthy that satisfaction with pay did not show differences between stayers and leavers.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>We recommend three courses of action that could prevent employees from leaving:</p>
  <ol role=""list"">
   <li>Revise business processes to grant employees more autonomy and discretion over the projects they are working on.&nbsp;</li>
   <li>Create professional growth opportunities or make existing opportunities more salient and visible.</li>
   <li>Differentially recognize (but not necessarily financially reward) high performers and create high visibility recognition events for employee achievements.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The second analysis suggested that three clusters of <a href=""/reflect""><strong>manager behaviors</strong></a> may help retain their employees. These manager behaviors are aligned with the three themes in employee sentiment. Managers are more likely to teams with high intent to stay with the organization if they:</p>
  <ol role=""list"">
   <li>Delegate tasks in a way that creates empowered teams</li>
   <li>Provide growth opportunities and actively coach their team</li>
   <li>Recognize high-performers</li>
  </ol>
  <p>We recommend evaluating manager skills in these areas (for example through Rhabit) and training low-performing managers on these skills. This could be a cost-effective and fast way to increase retention.&nbsp;</p>
  <h1>Research Questions</h1>
  <p>The Rhabit Analytics team sought answers to these two questions:</p>
  <ol role=""list"">
   <li>Do employees <strong>who have left the company</strong> think differently about their company than the employees who stayed?</li>
   <li>Are there any specific clusters of leadership behaviors that may affect <strong>employees' turnover intention</strong> and the act of leaving the organization?</li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Research Question 1</h1>
  <p>Given the exploratory nature of this analysis, we selected descriptive and point-biserial correlations as the main analysis tools. Descriptive statistics were implemented in the Power BI dashboard available to the client. In the bar charts and tables below, active (i.e. employed) employees are compared to those who have left this organization. All analyses are broken down by scale (Diversity and Inclusion, Engagement, Job Satisfaction and Loyalty, Opportunity for Growth, Performance Management and Pay).&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>Descriptive Statistics Results</h2>
  <h4><em>Diversity and Inclusion</em></h4>
  <p>For the Diversity and Inclusion scale, three items show substantive differences between active and departed employees:</p>
  <ul role=""list"">
   <li>I feel like I belong at this company.</li>
   <li>My company gives out rewards fairly, based on merit and skill, not based on status.</li>
   <li>My leaders make me feel like I am part of the group.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>‍</p>
  <h4><em>Engagement</em></h4>
  <p>The largest difference between active and departed employees is for:</p>
  <ul role=""list"">
   <li>I am able to influence my project assignment.</li>
   <li>My talents are used well in the workplace.</li>
   <li>I have the ability to influence the growth and success of my company.</li>
   <li>My company acknowledges me when I do a good job.</li>

  <p>‍</p>
  <h4><em>Job Satisfaction and Loyalty</em></h4>
  <p>Interestingly, we did not observe large differences between the two groups for the Job Satisfaction and Loyalty Scale. The biggest difference existed for the item “I am unlikely to leave my company in the next 12 months”. This indicates that this question reflects a person’s likelihood of leaving, but only to a small degree.&nbsp;</p>

  <h4><em>Opportunity for Growth</em></h4>
  <p>For this scale, the largest discrepancies existed for the items:</p>

   <li>My projects at my company are aligned with my interests&nbsp;</li>
   <li>My supervisor encourages me to participate in professional development opportunities.</li>
   <li>In my company, I have ongoing opportunities to learn and grow.</li>

  <p>‍</p>
  <h4><em>Performance Management and Pay</em></h4>
  <p>Contrary to our expectations, this scale did not show any substantive differences. The item “Given my skills, responsibilities, and job performance, I am fairly compensated.” showed only a 5 percentage point difference. We anticipated that dissatisfaction with pay would show a much larger, potentially the largest difference between groups and would be a significant driver of turnover. However, this was not supported by the data.</p>

  <h2>Summary and Recommendations: Research Question 1&nbsp;</h2>
  <p>When looking across all 5 scales, three themes emerge: Autonomy, Growth, and Recognition.&nbsp;</p>
  <h4><em>Autonomy</em></h4>
  <p>The items “I am able to influence my project assignment.”, “I have the ability to influence the growth and success of my company.”, and “My projects are aligned with my interests.” had a strong relationship with with turnover. All three items revolve around the employees’ ability to experience autonomy over their work.</p>
  <p>It may be reasonable to revise business processes to grant employees even more autonomy. Follow-up interviews may be helpful to clarify if the need for autonomy is stronger or weaker for more junior consultants. It seems plausible that more tenured consultants may feel that they could take on more responsibility and are ready for bigger assignments.</p>
  <h4><em>Growth</em></h4>
  <p>The second theme was Growth. The items “My talents are used well in the workplace.”, “My supervisor encourages me to participate in professional development opportunities.”, “In my company, I have ongoing opportunities to learn and grow.”, and “My talents are used well in the workplace.” are fairly strongly related to turnover. All items revolve around the employees’ ability to expand their skill set and fuel their professional development.</p>
  <p>This theme may be thought of as an extension of the Autonomy theme: Employees at the consultancy are motivated to grow as professionals and are seeking autonomy to apply their technical expertise. It may be recommendable to review career paths at the organization and make learning opportunities as salient as possible.</p>
  <h4><em>Recognition and Accountability</em></h4>
  <p>Finally, the third theme seems to revolve around the availability of recognition. The items “My company acknowledges me when I do a good job.” and “My company gives out rewards fairly, based on merit and skill, not based on status.” showed a strong relationship with turnover.&nbsp; Note that “rewards” are not defined as financial rewards and that financial rewards did not emerge as a driver of turnover.</p>
  <p>This theme completes the picture of the motivated consultant seeking growth. Whereas financial rewards may not have an effect, being seen and validated may matter to the organization’s employees. It may be recommendable to identify further opportunities to recognize employees for their work and effort.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>For example, two Rhabit clients similar to this organization (consulting firms with highly trained consultants) feature high performers in their semi-annual company meetings. Winners of specific performance categories (best client support, best improvement idea, best R&amp;D contribution) are congratulated on stage and are celebrated for their accomplishments.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The flip side of recognition is that low performers are <em>not</em> recognized, and therefore a <em>differential treatment</em> of high and low performers exists. Therefore, we recommend that the recognition is closely tied to performance.</p>
  <h1>Research Question 2: Manager Effects on Turnover Intentions</h1>
  <p>For research question 1 we looked for relationships between employee sentiment (questions in the engagement survey) with turnover events. For research question 2 we selected as independent variable a specific cluster of <strong>Manager Behaviors</strong>. While employee sentiment is important, it cannot be directly changed. Manager behavior, however, can be influenced directly, either through training or new policy.</p>
  <p>As a dependent variable, we chose <strong>Intent to Stay (ITS)</strong>. This variable is a compound score of:</p>
  <ul role=""list"">
   <li>I am generally satisfied with my job.</li>
   <li>I recommend my company as a great place to work.</li>
   <li>I am unlikely to leave my company in the next 12 months.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We selected ITS because turnover is a very noisy variable. Perfectly happy employees may leave the organization for job-unrelated reasons, and unhappy or dissatisfied employees may stay with the organization for job-unrelated reasons. Therefore, the effects of the independent variable may not be strongly related to the turnover event. An employee’s Intent to Stay may be more sensitive to managers' leadership behavior than the noisier event of turnover.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>We correlated ITS with key managerial behaviors that correspond to the three themes identified in the section above. We hypothesized that <strong>Autonomy</strong> should be aligned with the manager behavior Delegating Tasks, <strong>Growth</strong> should be aligned with Coaching for Current Role, and <strong>Recognition and Accountability</strong> should be aligned with Creating a Performance Environment.&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>Delegating Tasks</h3>
  <p>Unfortunately, the habit Delegating Task was not assigned to a sufficient number of managers. Therefore, no meaningful analyses were possible.&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>Coaching for Current Role</h3>
  <p>However, <strong>Coaching for Current Role</strong> had sufficient data points to allow for a more thorough analysis.</p>
  <p>In the correlation table below the correlation coefficient of Coaching behaviors and ITS are displayed. With two exceptions, all coaching behaviors correlated positively with ITS. It seems reasonable to assume that an involved manager who proactively coaches is a key factor in individuals’ decisions to stay with the company. This finding also echoes the Growth theme mentioned above. An involved and nurturing manager may meet the employees’ needs for professional development. Note that the correlations were -- though sizeable-- not significant at the 5% level.</p>
  <p>‍</p>

   </div>
  </figure>
  <p>‍</p>
  <h3>Creating a Performance Environment</h3>
  <p>Creating a performance environment captures many manager behaviors that ensure the differential recognition of employees based on their performance. However, Creating a Performance Environment did not correlate substantively with ITS.&nbsp;</p>
  <figure style=""max-width: 644pxpx"" class=""w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"">
   <div>
    <img src=""https://cdn.humareso.com/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/660478254d36ebd178daa195_Screen%20Shot%202024-03-27%20at%203_48_35%20PM.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt="""">
   </div>
  </figure>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>A follow-up analysis suggested that the <strong>general performance of the employee</strong> may be an important moderator. Specifically, a high accountability manager may only positively affect high performers whereas low performers may not like working under such a manager.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Analyses of other client data sets suggested that general performance would be a moderator of this relationship. As a follow-up analysis, a simple OLS Regression was run with ITS as a dependent variable. The interaction term Accountability * Employee Performance was included and was significant.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>A plot of the interaction term is displayed below.</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <figure style=""max-width: 712pxpx"" class=""w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"">
   <div>
    <img src=""https://cdn.humareso.com/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/660475cf560dbd396ba67057_NtOUOK51UiJk4IZ3Zae5BaJP9oCo7zKALtZJIR9e345HAizhjjJ1zOzn3OtEU43lYosjQwbAbHuq9fSztg2QTnQcJ-MCJSy-rmk6rtMTrVD8-hPFDC9Zzn6p1ar0.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt="""">
   </div>
  </figure>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>The plot can be interpreted as follows: A low-rated Employee (red line) is negatively affected by a high accountability leader in terms of their Loyalty to the organization. In contrast, a highly rated employee (blue line) will be positively affected by a high-accountability leader. This means that high accountability leaders will drive retention of higher-performing employees. However, the reverse is also true, low accountability leaders will negatively affect high-performing leaders in terms of their loyalty.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <h2>Summary and Recommendations: Research Question 2&nbsp;</h2>
  <p>The analyses for research question 2 complement the findings for research question 1: Employees seek out work environments in which they can grow as professionals. Managers who provide such growth opportunities can help retain these employees. Employees also want to be recognized. We saw this theme reflected in the habit Creating a Performance Environment: Managers who hold their employees accountable (i.e. recognize high performers but not recognize low performers) are more likely to increase their intent to stay.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>However, the correlation was obscured by the presence of an important moderator: <a href=""/performance-management""><strong>employee performance</strong></a>. High and low-performing employees are differentially affected by this manager behavior. While high performers will display more loyalty with high-accountability leaders, low performers will display less loyalty. This is an important finding because increasing accountability will help retain the most valuable employees and failing to establish this manager behavior will lead to a higher likelihood of high-value employees leaving.</p>

  <ol role=""list"">
   <li>Evaluate if managers have strong coaching skills and offer training to strengthen these skills.</li>
   <li>Evaluate if managers have the resources to deploy training resources with their direct reports.</li>
   <li>Evaluate if managers are skilled in creating high-accountability teams and have the resources to recognize high-performing employees.&nbsp;</li>
   <li>Evaluate if managers have the skill and discretion to address performance issues with low-performers.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>In addition, we extend our recommendations to ensure that managers are trained and skilled to effectively delegate tasks and subsequently maximize the autonomy of their direct reports.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I had the pleasure of attending <a href=""https://www.workhumanlive.com/"">WorkHuman Live</a>, once again, this past week. One of the things I love about this conference is its ability to drive diverse kinds of workplace conversations amongst attendees. We are offered opportunities to connect and to discuss what we’ve been hearing from the content delivered. We share ideas and dream about what could be in our organizations. We find those like-minded individuals who will help encourage us and keep us accountable. It is an incredibly special time.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>What struck me most this year might be surprising, but it was the vulnerability of Brene Brown. <a href=""https://brenebrown.com/"">Brene</a> has been a speaker at this conference before, and did not disappoint, but this time, she was setup with a conversational opportunity. She sat comfortably in a chair, joined by Eric Moseley, CEO, where questions were asked about HR, AI and the human response. As expected, Brene had some research to offer. It was helpful.</p>
<p>But what wound up happening was that Brene started to share personal perspectives. She shared about her own journey and where she finds herself today. Brene owned how uncomfortable she is at times with the attention she’s been given. She vulnerably shared that this last year was one of the most difficult for her in relationship with her family, her work and even, herself. At one point, Brene said, “I sit back and wonder sometimes, ‘What if I had not done the Netflix special?’ Would things be better?” Wow. What a statement.</p>
<p>Brene was a person at that moment. She was not a world-famous researcher who has more than a handful best-selling books and who sits to chat with Oprah. She was raw and unafraid of her vulnerabilities. The pain she has been experiencing was palpable. She was honest in a fresh way. With all that she has achieved, there are consequences to that success that has challenged her view of self and of those relationships around her.</p>
<p>The reminder that the view we have of someone in the public eye is not as complete as we’d like to believe it is. As humans, we are wired to label and categorize. We might look at someone like Brene and apply various labels regarding success, public speaking, writing and celebrity to her. And here she sat, on a stage in front of about 2500 people as alone as you could imagine. That label would not have been one that I would have used for her prior to WorkHuman Live 2024.</p>
<p><a href=""https://blog.humareso.com/facing-discomfort-develops-critical-respons"">Compassionate consideration</a> that we do not know what is going on in each person’s life is not merely a good HR skill to possess, but it’s a right consideration for all people to have. I don’t know what is really going on in your life, nor do you know all that is going on in mine. What you think you know about anyone’s past or future is based on what you see or what you have heard, even from the person directly. No person shares everything with another. We hold back. That truth should influence the labeling and presuppositions you have swirling in your head.</p>
<p>Brene reminded us all that she is a researcher. She, also, reminded us that she is an absolute introvert. Self-awareness had come front and center for Brene. She realized that she had been operating outside of who she really is. Perhaps she believed her own press a little too much. Perhaps she applied the labels that others gave her as truth. Regardless of the reason, Brene gave us a glimpse into a self-identification reckoning.</p>
<p>WorkHuman Live gave me the chance to consider both the inward view of self as well as the actualized portrayal of self to the world. Am I at odds? And further, the reminder that I don’t know everything going on with people, even the people that I am most closely connected to. Do I leave room for vulnerability? I can only own my reactions and responses. Time for a checkup on that.</p>

Prepare for storms, disasters, and other events. HR. ","2024-04-11 13:45:00","2024-04-29T21:00:01.089Z","<p><img src=""https://cdn.humareso.com/hubfs/Humareso%20Blog%20Posts-11-Storm%20Front%20Coming_%20Why%20You%20Need%20an%20Inclement%20Weat.jpeg"" width=""860"" height=""459"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Humareso Blog Posts-11-Storm Front Coming_ Why You Need an Inclement Weat"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 860px;"">Yesterday, here along the Gulf Coast of the US, an outbreak of storms (wind, rain, tornado warnings), had us at heel before it moved along on its eastward swing.</p>
<p>Personally, since we’re a remote-forward organization, I didn’t have much to worry about other than wondering if I would lose electricity and/or WiFi. (Naturally, because we pay heed to the local meteorologists, we also had our shelter-in-place room ready, made sure the generator was geared up, and laid in a supply of “storm snacks.”).</p>
<p>Yet, as I wandered about the internet and various discussion boards (WiFi survived!), I was once again struck by the number of companies that fail to plan for either inclement weather or other types of disasters that may befall their business operations.<!--more--><strong><u>Rock You Like a Hurricane </u></strong></p>
<p>On the business operations side it’s important to have a well-defined Disaster Recovery Plan; a working document that outlines what to do when the unexpected happens. The unexpected event could be a natural disaster (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yP1tcy9a10&amp;t=18s"">hurricane</a>, flooding, wildfires) or something as traumatic as an incident of workplace violence or an active shooting. In addition to addressing business continuity and operations, the Disaster Recovery Plan also addresses employee-centric items such as communication, resources for staff, pay continuity, and plans to address individual situations and needs.</p>
<p>Ideally, you rarely (if ever) have to activate your Disaster Recovery Plan, but should be prepared to do so nonetheless. (Tip: regularly review the Plan and conduct an annual “tabletop exercise” with the leadership team to make sure all elements are current and applicable).</p>
<h4><strong><u>Stormy Weather</u></strong></h4>
<p>An inclement <em>(severe, rough or harsh; stormy)</em> weather policy, on the other hand, is one you may find yourself referring to regularly. Who among us hasn’t faced a seemingly “normal” weather phenomenon that gets out of hand? The April showers that promise to turn into 3+ inches of rain over just a few hours? The <a href=""https://www.cnet.com/science/climate/what-is-a-bomb-cyclone-heres-why-its-so-brutal/"">bomb-cyclone</a> that threatens a densely populated geographic area?</p>
<p><em>“Sure,”</em> we often think to ourselves, <em>“we may get a big snow storm every few years, but we can handle that. We don’t need a POLICY about it.”</em></p>
<p>Until we <strong><em>can’t </em></strong>handle it.</p>
<p>Developing a policy (and a plan!) before you need one, will save lots of angst and aggravation for the time when you are, to put it mildly, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2AC41dglnM"">thunderstruck</a>. (gratuitous shoutout to AC/DC!)</p>
<h4><strong><u>Hazy Shade of Winter</u></strong></h4>
<p>Obviously, the ability for companies to fully shut down or institute a “work from home” day varies; health care facilities and hospitals are open regardless of the weather whereas an independent insurance agency with 15 employees can more readily tell everyone the “office” will be closed but employees should plan to work from home.</p>
<p>So how to develop <strong>your </strong>Inclement Weather policy? Here are just a few of the items you should evaluate, consider, and include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Define inclement weather. </strong>Does this include forecasted snow over xx amount? Will you take your cue from local government declarations (i.e. school or government closures)? You may also want to determine the difference between inclement weather and a natural disaster?</li>
<li><strong>Who will make the decision to close, delay opening or close early? </strong>Can an individual manager (of an office, team, or location) make that call or does it need to come from “corporate?” (CEO? HR Leader?)?</li>
<li><strong>Who will communicate this decision? </strong>Are the mechanisms in place to get the message delivered? While a companywide e-mail may work for some organizations, if you have a largely hourly workforce not everyone will have company email. Will you utilize SMS messaging or an old-fashioned “phone tree.” And how much notice, ideally, should be given?</li>
<li><strong>Are there jobs that must be performed (i.e. in person) regardless of inclement weather or closure?</strong> What are those jobs and who does them? What if that person is unavailable if, for example, they cannot leave their neighborhood due to impassable roadways?</li>
<li><strong>Can employees work from home? </strong>What if they CAN work from home but due to the weather, they lose electricity or internet access? Will they still be paid?</li>
<li><strong>How will you pay non-exempt employees if the business closes? </strong>Must they use PTO if they don’t report and can’t work from home? What if the non-exempt employee reports to work, the business closes…but the employee is unable to leave *due to weather) and continues to work? (note: make sure your policy is in compliance with both the <a href=""https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/flsa"">Fair Labor Standards Act</a> (FLSA) as well as any applicable state laws requiring payment of a minimum number of hours).</li>
<li><strong>How will you pay exempt employees? </strong>The US Department of Labor, in an <a href=""https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/WHD/legacy/files/2005_10_28_46_FLSA.pdf"">opinion letter</a>, clarified that <em>”If the employer closes operations due to a weather related emergency or other disaster for less than a full workweek, then the employer must pay an exempt employee “the full salary for any week in which the employee performs any work without regard to the number of days or hours worked,” because “deductions may not be made for time when work is not available.” </em>(note: the opinion letter also addresses the situation when it may be appropriate to utilize accrued PTO however no “deduction” of pay may occur).</li>
<li><strong>Can employees use accrued PTO? What if they don’t have any accrued PTO? </strong>Consider the interplay of your Inclement Weather Policy with your PTO Policy and procedures. Evaluate if you are penalizing employees who have exhausted their PTO balance – especially when you may have a calendar year “use it or lose it” policy and the giant snowstorm hits the 3<sup>rd</sup> week of December.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><u>Raindrops Keep Fallin’ On My Head</u></strong></h4>
<p>Whew!</p>
<p>It’s a lot to think about. And let’s face it - we often don’t develop an Inclement Weather Policy because we figure we’ll just deal with it when it happens.</p>
<p>But it happens. A lot.</p>
<p>And then, as HR professionals or business leaders, we scramble – <strong>while in the MIDST of the situation </strong>– to make decisions and answer questions that could have been memorialized (and communicated!) ahead of time.</p>
<p>Word of advice? <a href=""https://humareso.com/hr-services"">Write that policy</a> now…because <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQetemT1sWc&amp;t=9s"">Here Comes the Sun</a>.</p>

  <h1><strong>Why Leadership Assessments Fail – And How to Fix Them</strong></h1>
  <p>Traditional leadership assessments often encounter roadblocks such as low participation and questionable data quality. The problem lies in the very nature of these assessments: They're often time-consuming, lack psychological safety, and fail to provide a clear path to improvement based on the gathered feedback. This leaves organizations struggling to obtain the valuable insights needed for effective leadership development.</p>
  <p>However, frequent feedback processes can be a game-changer. Partnering with solutions like <a href=""/leadership-development"">Rhabit Reflect </a>can overcome these challenges and revolutionize <a href=""/reflect-360"">leadership development</a>.</p>
  <h1><strong>A Case Study: Rhabit's Success with a National Insurance Company</strong></h1>
  <p>A major national insurance and financial services company with thousands of employees sought to implement a feedback platform to help measure and reinforce specific behaviors to prove impact of its leadership development program.

He is waiting for the right moment because when he starts this relationship with her, he is all in. There won’t be any turning back. He wants to ask her out at the right moment to set that tone from the onset. He’s waiting with a purpose.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>And we might be working with some of those “waiters” as well. Over 90% of Gen Z and Millennial <a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/quitting-jobs-higher-pay-economic-confidence-growing-gen-z-millennials-2024-1#:~:text=That's%20according%20to%20a%20new,Xers%20and%2048%25%20of%20Boomers."">employees</a> would like to change jobs this year. The percentage, however, falls dramatically when pushed as to whether they really will.</p>
<p>The economic environment is affecting the confidence that our employees have about moving on. Most feel that it’s necessary to move on as it will likely open doors for higher pay and greater responsibility. There are varying studies showing different results regarding compensation differentiation based on staying or leaving. For instance, a recent analysis done by Sentinel Pay Analytics for an organization with about 23,000 employees showed no difference in pay levels between those who’ve stayed and those who boomeranged back to the company. That’s not the case in all organizations, but banking on it in the current economic state appears too risky.</p>
<p>“The number one thing people are craving right now is stability—especially in their workplaces,” said Ella F. Washington, PhD, an organizational psychologist and professor of practice at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business. This jives with what many of you are facing. And while employees may have interest in leaving as soon as they feel confident to do so, we don’t have to accept that fate. Organizations can take steps to change that trajectory.</p>
<p>Own dialogue – Look to engage with people…on purpose. For managers and human resources practitioners, the no news is good news philosophy has affected our intentionality with our staff. We stay distant and we chat only about <a href=""https://blog.humareso.com/what-have-you-done-for-me-lately"">work process</a> or product. These heavily transactional conversations cause a utilitarian vibe to be felt by our employees. Engage with work-related conversations, of course, but also recognize that performance-based dialogue includes skill development in relationally areas, too. Work with your team by talking to your team.</p>
<p>Encourage innovation – Too often we’re too busy. We cannot take the time to foster creativity because we have deadlines or quotas to meet. We keep our eyes on only the finish line, and we fail to meet people in innovative advancements. Your teams have ideas. They want processes to be better. They see the value in what they are doing, but they also want to influence what they are doing. They want to make a change for the good of the whole, truly. We may be tempted to minimize creativity because of that one time it didn’t work out. Innovation leaves room for failure so don’t be surprised that you will have to try again. It is not a reason to stop pushing forward.</p>
<p>Offer transparency in moderation – Organizations that function fully in transparency – sharing every data point possible – may unintentionally foster <a href=""https://greatnotbig.com/2011/06/some-downsides-of-a-transparent-company/"">fear</a>. When sales fall slightly, or when expenses increase over one month, we might have to handle worries from the team. This is not to say that transparency is bad; actually, quite the opposite. Employees feel more tied to the organization when they have a level of understanding as well as the opportunity to ask deeper questions. Allow for that while keeping considerate of how much data is going out.</p>
<p>It's not too late to keep some people who may be thinking about a move, delayed as it may be. The current economy might give organizations a false sense of security. You may not be doing as well as you think just because turnover is down. The economic stagnation, presidential election, high inflation, and other considerations could be affecting the status quo nature of employee retention.</p>
<p>And to be clear, there are still employees leaving their roles now. We can’t look at data so hard and fast in all categories. The trend is not universal, nor should it be. Either way, taking a look at how you might influence a change in direction is worth your time.</p>

  <h1>How to Develop High-Performing Manufacturing Managers</h1>
  <p>Manager behaviors have been a key factor driving critical success in attracting and retaining top talent. However, collecting feedback from frontline employees has been a continued challenge for most manufacturers and logistics companies. HR managers have limited options to create the frequent feedback and analytics needed to make data-driven recommendations to their C-Suite to impact cultural change.</p>
  <p>Engaging workers in production and fulfillment environments presents unique challenges like high turnover, low psychological safety, and difficulty in reaching employees due to technological limitations. Even more so, HR managers in these organizations often face limited bandwidth to plan, deploy, and analyze the feedback at any frequency, aside from a traditional annual survey.</p>
  <p>So, let’s start with manager behaviors and why they are so important.</p>
  <h1>Managers influence their team cultures every day</h1>
  <p>No one in the organization has a greater influence on a team than the team’s leader. The everyday behaviors of a manager impact employee job satisfaction, performance, and retention, so when a manager is behaving in a way that drives disengagement, it will negatively impact the organization.</p>
  <p>Now, going back to the conundrum HR managers face: <strong>“How do I get honest feedback about how a manager is behaving in the workplace?”</strong>.</p>
  <h1>The three factors in collecting high-quality feedback on manager behaviors</h1>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>Collecting honest feedback is <em>hard, </em>especially when a manager may have low trust, or when employees may fear retaliation in the event they give less than favorable feedback about their manager to their employer.</p>
  <p><strong>Objectivity:</strong> When defining the behaviors of a model manager for your organization, think about the <em>observable behaviors</em> of that individual rather than the way that person makes people feel. You may choose to align this with your core values, or if you have a competency model that’s a great place to start. Align these objective, observable behaviors to these competencies.<br><br>For example, if you want to develop accountability in your managers, you may create behaviors like, “NAME holds team members accountable for their performance” or “NAME sets clear performance goals for the team”.<br><br><strong>Psychological Safety:</strong> For feedback programs to be effective, there has to be a high level of trust and psychological safety within the organization. Unfortunately, manufacturers often struggle with having a high-trust environment across the entire organization.This is why Rhabit feedback is anonymous and based on observable behaviors rather than form-based feedback that is difficult to write effectively if you’re not used to giving feedback to others. Using simple swipe technology Rhabit anonymously collects small pieces of feedback, building trust and confidence in the feedback process over time.<br></p>
  <p><strong>Actionable, Transparent Reporting:</strong> Administrators are the obvious benefactors of collecting frequent feedback about manager behaviors, but to drive self-awareness and impact measurable behavior change the managers themselves need to have access to the feedback. When given access to their Rhabit dashboards, most managers naturally start to improve their performance which, in turn, starts to positively impact the engagement of their team. </p>
  <p>‍<br></p>
  <h1><strong>A Case Study in Action: Empowering Managers, Driving Results</strong></h1>
  <p>Rhabit has the capability to reach employees at every level of an organization using simple swipe technology that is fast and easy to use on a phone or even a kiosk. Using elements of gamification, Rhabit takes the monotony out of giving frequent feedback, and encourages honest participation to help managers perform their best. </p>

  <p>One instance of manager behaviors driving success comes from an advanced manufacturer that implemented Rhabit in 2020. Their focus was on <strong>strengthening manager performance</strong> and its impact on employee engagement. Here's what they achieved:</p>
  <ul role=""list"">
   <li><strong>9% increase</strong> in feedback scores related to <strong>creating a performance environment</strong>, indicating that managers are actively fostering a culture of continuous feedback and development, motivating their teams to excel.</li>
   <li><strong>12% higher engagement score</strong> compared to the industry benchmark, specifically related to <strong>receiving sufficient performance feedback</strong>. This signifies that employees feel heard, valued, and supported in their growth journey.</li>
  </ul>

<p>The Antiques Roadshow is a revelation. Each episode highlights people with “finds” from Grandma’s attic, or similar place, as they wait in line to meet with a value expert from a particular field of antiquity. The go-to-auction prices knock me off my chair at times. Who would pay such a price? The antique experts say there are those people out there. I believe them since it’s their business. But the basic business concept still rings true: People will pay what they believe it’s worth, not what someone tells them it’s worth.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In the world of human resources products – SaaS products and the like – that concept still works. Tools like employee engagement software may not be a must-have in a recession-fearful economy, and we’re seeing some pricing reductions happening as a result, but companies <em>are</em> paying for what they believe has value right now.</p>
<p>So, what’s the focus in HR technology? Ask any expert and they’ll point to about fifteen items, but it seems as if there are two main areas of spend happening. Those areas are artificial intelligence (AI) tools and pay transparency software.</p>
<p>AI, specifically generative AI, which can quickly generate diverse content formats – text, images, audio, or video—upon user prompts, is rapidly gaining traction. The rub now is adoption. As quickly as companies can get it bought and implemented, they are then pushing for robust usage. In a world of talent shortage, by the numbers, AI seemingly fills a need, and companies are willing to spend for it.</p>
<p>Companies will need to be proactive in establishing infrastructure to handle the <a href=""https://blog.humareso.com/two-less-lonely-people"">process</a> of AI usage as well as how people will integrate their work with this newer “Tech Colleague.” Remember, the goal of the buyer is to streamline operations, both internal and external, for both a better workplace experience as well as competitive advantages in delivery and responsiveness.</p>
<p>And unless you’ve been asleep at the wheel, there has been a paradigm shift towards increased transparency in pay practices. Besides navigating pay transparency regulations (see AI support integration above!), there is, also, the push for valid and reliable pay equity analysis.</p>
<p>While compliance remains a cornerstone, pay equity analyses and compensation benchmarking work supported through robust technology will foster a more inclusive and equitable workplace culture. Having technology that will support compliance and value-based decision-making is a must in the competitive landscape of work today.</p>
<p>Employee well-being and satisfaction are by-products of such an approach to pay transparency which aligns, also, with a potential spend on employee experience software. Companies may be looking for more than just a survey or an annual snapshot in time as to how things are going; they hunger for more relevant and consistent knowledge of their teams.</p>
<p>We want meaningful interactions, a commitment to recognition, and an opportunity to express it. Data-driven insights researched, stored, and tracked through robust experiential technology will drive long-term success. The juice will be worth the squeeze when committed to tech spend like this, though it is not a current priority for the small to lower mid-market organizations, by employee size.</p>
<p>Listen, not every painting in the attic will be worth $250,000 at auction, but you may find that bringing a few items valued at a lesser amount each will still get you to that magic number. These technology categories won’t work as a plug-and-play, but rather as integrated components to a workplace strategy. And the ROI (return on investment) of using these HR tech tools will be tracked, measured, and validated through their usage, company performance metrics, and employee satisfaction sentiment sharing.</p>
<p>The spend tells us what is worth it, at least as of today. Follow it and see if it would work for your organization.</p>

  <h2><strong>Is it time to retire the annual engagement survey?</strong></h2>
  <p>For decades, the annual employee engagement survey has been a staple in corporate culture. Engagement surveys are an important tool used by organizations to measure the health of their culture and to understand areas that require improvement in morale and leadership.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Yet, in today's rapidly evolving business landscape, is this once-a-year snapshot still effective in measuring and boosting employee engagement? Executives and HR leaders are increasingly questioning its <a href=""https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/blog/human-capital-blog/2023/advance-your-employee-listening-strategy.html"">relevance </a>and for good reason.</p>
  <h2><strong>Why The Annual Survey Is Outdated:</strong></h2>
  <ul role=""list"">
   <li><strong>Limited Data:</strong> Point-in-time engagement surveys only produce a single data point per year providing a limited view of cultural health. This allows for potentially disastrous pockets of disengagement to grow until the next survey discovers there is an issue. It's like trying to navigate a mountain trek with no map, compass, or satellite phone - it’s rife for disaster.</li>
   <li><strong>Difficult to measure:</strong> Capturing accurate employee engagement sentiments can be difficult, especially with populations who work in shifts or production lines. Traditional form-based surveys make it difficult to get timely engagement feedback from a large population, and often result in inaccurate data.</li>
   <li><strong>Lacking psychological safety:</strong> Many employees view traditional surveys with skepticism, believing they're a box-checking exercise with little follow-up action. This fuels disengagement and cynicism.</li>
   <li><strong>Lagging Action and Impact:</strong> By the time survey results are analyzed and translated into actionable steps (if at all), employee concerns have likely evolved or been forgotten. The opportunity window for meaningful intervention quickly closes, lessening the impact of a company response.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2><strong>Why Continuous Listening Is A Business Imperative:</strong></h2>
  <p>High-performing companies are leading the charge by embracing <a href=""/employee-engagement""><strong>continuous listening</strong></a><strong> platforms</strong> like Rhabit Analytics. These platforms move beyond annual surveys, collecting frequent feedback on engagement sentiments <strong>throughout the year</strong>.</p>
  <h3><strong>The Advantages of Continuous Listening For Employee Engagement Programs:</strong></h3>
  <ul role=""list"">
   <li><strong>Real-Time Insights:</strong> Pulse surveys and micro-engagement check-ins gather data in real time, providing a constant pulse on employee sentiment. This allows for early identification of potential issues and timely interventions.</li>
   <li><strong>Increased Participation:</strong> Gamified and <a href=""/about-us"">mobile-friendly</a> formats encourage wider participation, ensuring voices from all levels of the organization are heard.</li>
   <li><strong>Actionable Data:</strong> Powerful analytics translate feedback into actionable insights, pinpointing specific areas for improvement and tracking the impact of initiatives.</li>
   <li><strong>Enhanced Trust and Transparency:</strong> Frequent feedback loops and demonstrably responsive actions foster trust and transparency, demonstrating the company's genuine commitment to employee well-being.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2><strong>The Results Speak for Themselves:</strong></h2>
  <h3>Companies deploying continuous listening platforms report:</h3>
  <ul role=""list"">
   <li><strong>Increased Employee Retention:</strong> These companies see lower turnover rates by proactively addressing concerns and fostering a culture of feedback.</li>
   <li><strong>Improved Business Outcomes:</strong> Engaged employees are more productive, innovative, and customer-centric, leading to superior financial performance.</li>
   <li><strong>Stronger Employer Brand:</strong> A vibrant and engaged workforce attracts and retains top talent, creating a competitive advantage.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2><strong>The Bottom Line:</strong></h2>
  <p>The annual employee engagement survey has served its purpose, but it's time may be up. By embracing continuous listening platforms, companies can better understand employee sentiment, make data-driven decisions, and build a culture that fosters engagement, retention, and business success.</p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 22px; font-family: Georgia, Palatino, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"">Yet, in the realm of human experience, “love” is often associated with the relationships we have with romantic partners, friends, family, and higher-order beings while we often overlook its significance in the workplace. And love at work <strong>is </strong>significant; who among us hasn’t had an acquaintance exclaim “I just LOVE my job!” Expressions of affection towards one’s job are not uncommon, and the sentiment resonates with many…even if it may fade over time.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 22px; font-family: Georgia, Palatino, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"">As employees we WANT to love our jobs; we want that spine-tingling <a href=""https://humareso.com/recruitment"">“I just got an offer!”</a> feeling to last for years and years.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 22px; font-family: Georgia, Palatino, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;""><u><strong><!--more-->What’s Love Got to Do </strong><span style=""color: #474747;""><strong>with</strong></span><strong> It</strong></u></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 22px; font-family: Georgia, Palatino, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"">The ancient Greek philosophers identified 6 kinds of love:</span></p>
<ul style=""font-size: 22px;"">
<li><span style=""font-family: Georgia, Palatino, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;""><a href=""https://blog.humareso.com/missing-you"">Familial love</a> (storge)</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: Georgia, Palatino, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 22px;""><span style=""background-color: transparent;"">Friendly/platonic love (philia)</span></span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: Georgia, Palatino, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"">Romantic love (eros)</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: Georgia, Palatino, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"">Self-love (philautia)</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: Georgia, Palatino, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"">Guest love (xenia)</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: Georgia, Palatino, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"">Unconditional/Divine love (agape)</span></li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><span style=""font-size: 22px; font-family: Georgia, Palatino, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"">Fully defining and clarifying the meaning of love, in its ancient manifestations or more current iterations, can be the subject of hours of debate. Not only are there historical evolutions of the essence of love, but there are also numerous <a href=""https://humareso.com/diversity-equity-inclusion"">cross-cultural</a> considerations as well.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 22px; font-family: Georgia, Palatino, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"">For purposes of today’s musings, however, let’s clarify that the concept of LOVE in the workplace is simply defined as <strong>the positive feelings one person experiences for another person</strong> (or entity in this case). It’s not courtly. Not familial. And not – please not - romantic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 22px; font-family: Georgia, Palatino, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;""><strong><u>All the Feelz</u></strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 22px; font-family: Georgia, Palatino, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"">To be meaningful, workplace affection needs to be reciprocal. Similar to personal relationships, there’s nothing worse than unrequited love. If I ""love my job!"" (as stated above) then I sure as heck want to feel a bit of tenderness coming back towards me from my employer.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 22px; font-family: Georgia, Palatino, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"">Despite the conventional perception of work being solely transactional, the reality is that the emotional connections formed within the workplace can <strong>profoundly</strong> impact both the individual (by enhancing personal well-being) AND the organization. After all, employees that are cared for - “loved” - will do their best to meet goals, support each other, and drive success.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 22px; font-family: Georgia, Palatino, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"">Now the company – and most critically the individual manager! – can foster love and affection in the workplace by first and foremost recognizing employees as people; living, breathing human beings who have emotional needs and opinions. People who are much more than an employee number tracked in a payroll system.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 22px; font-family: Georgia, Palatino, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"">And just as they do with those near and dear at home, managers can demonstrate admiration, respect, and thoughtfulness towards their staff. It’s about listening and talking. It’s being empathetic. It’s creating a supportive environment where individuals feel safe to be themselves and express their vulnerabilities without fear of judgement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 22px; font-family: Georgia, Palatino, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;""><strong><u>Where is the Love?</u></strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 22px;""><span style=""font-family: Georgia, Palatino, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"">As for the other partner in this relationship – the employee – there are, in fact, ways they can have agency in nurturing a healthy relationship with their employer. They certainly shouldn’t be expected to only GIVE without getting their needs met but must also take some actions to simultaneously promote good </span>feelings<span style=""font-family: Georgia, Palatino, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;""> and affection. Like any good partner, employees should:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-size: 22px; font-family: Georgia, Palatino, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"">Communicate; speak up and ask for what is needed.</span></li>

That’s it. That’s the message to take with you today.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<!--more-->
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Over the last couple of weeks to the last few months, the number of human resources professionals, talent acquisition leaders, DEI specialists and training coordinators laid off from their organizations has spiked. I’ve spoken to many of them. These are hard conversations as the uncertainty of what’s next is constricting. For some, it was like a vice around their necks as they tried to keep a stiff upper lip while video chatting with me. (PSA – I don’t need you to keep a stiff upper lip. I’m the guy whose lips will quiver and eyes will leak right along with you. You're safe with me). It is fearful and the current economy is tenuous at best, especially in our field. </span><span data-ccp-props=""{}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">And from these conversations, some themes have emerged. The short-sightedness of some companies in their reductions in force is staggering. We are still trending at a </span><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/navigating-employee-retention-2023-insights-trends-pedagog/""><span data-contrast=""none"">38% turnover rate</span></a><span data-contrast=""auto""> overall within the first year of employment. To continue to look at the broader human resources function as a throwaway because it’s “hard to find the ROI” is errant, and someone needs to connect the dots more clearly at that organization. We are not going to make that trend better by removing the inclusive-focused, employee-experience professionals from the building.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Concurrently, what has, also, been expressed are those regrettable relational truths:</span><span data-ccp-props=""{}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">“If I had only appreciated more what I had when I had it.”</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;335559685&quot;:720}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">“We were working so hard to get to a goal that I didn’t enjoy the journey.”</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;335559685&quot;:720}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">“I missed the value of people as I spent more time in data on dashboards than in conversations with people.”</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;335559685&quot;:720}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">The joy along the way. Like some other disciplines, the human resources profession can get wrapped up in results. The goals we set, or that get set for us, are drivers and in point of fact, they should be. It is ridiculous to think that our job is only to stop by employee breakrooms with cake and balloons as if we’re hosting the evening’s entertainment on the Acapulco Lounge on the Love Boat. Connecting with others matters, but it is not realistic to do so with only social chatter. Take hold of those objectives and chart out a thoughtful, deliberate and measurable path forward.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">And yet, the path forward is littered with opportunities for connection and relationship. Some of you…wait for it…work for companies that are pretty great. You like the majority of people there. You appreciate the constructs in places. You think the leadership of the organization, while continuing to develop, are open to collaboration and invite you to partake often. But it may have become so EOS or some other pathway driven that you’ve missed the </span><a href=""https://blog.humareso.com/coming-up""><span data-contrast=""none"">joy</span></a><span data-contrast=""auto""> along the way.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">This time of transition may drive home a better appreciation of what you had. Don’t be mad about it, but rather, reflect upon it. How great that you were there! You have made an impact and those ripples in the lives of others may go on for years, even without you knowing. Could you have paid better attention to it? Yes. Will it impact your perspective in your next role? Yes. It’s a learning opportunity, as cliché as you may find that.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{}"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">So, today, whether you are in transition or you are firmly planted at your current organization, stop and reflect upon the journey – the lives you’ve touched, the successes you’ve seen, the failures that galvanized a group of contributors and the opportunities you’ve opened and encouraged for others. The review will likely be more robust than you thought it would be. Enjoy it. All of it. The joy along the way is a gift for you, for those around you and for the company as a whole. Celebrate it while you’re there. Don’t wait to just look back on it when you miss it. Jump into the joy right now.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

  <h1>How to Build a Powerful Employee Engagement Program for Your Manufacturing Organization</h1>

You’ve successfully hired Bob to fill the Sr. Widget Specialist job you’ve had <a href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-research-shows-that-hiring-is-harder-than-ever-time-to-hire-increasing-significantly-for-almost-all-roles-301839785.html"">open for 6 months.</a> It was a challenging role to fill for a variety of reasons; factors that came into play included location, compensation, and organizational factors such as your WFH policy and benefit offerings.</p>
<p>With the start date of Bob confirmed (and he showed up!), it can be very easy to assume the “talent” part of the employee experience is over and done. You found the <strong>talent</strong>, acquired the <strong>talent</strong>, and now have the <strong>talent</strong> sitting at his desk and doing the work.</p>
<p><!--more-->But it’s not quite that simple. Nor is thinking about Bob’s <strong>talent</strong> - with which he is gifting your company! - over and done. Here’s how Merriam-Webster defines Bob’s “talent:”</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><em>“</em></strong><em>a special often athletic, creative, or artistic aptitude<strong>:&nbsp;</strong>general intelligence or mental power:</em> <em><span style=""color: #212529; background-color: white;"">a person of talent or a group of persons of talent in a field or activity</span>”</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong><u>What Often Happens</u></strong></h5>
<p>The term “talent,” when used in the realm of HR and a business context can be simultaneously ambiguous and pretentious. You may toss the word around, like jugglers at a side show, but how do you <strong>define</strong> talent in your organization? Do you even <strong>have </strong>a definition?</p>
<p>Some organizations (or more often than not - the managers and executives) consider it to <strong><u>only</u></strong> refer to the highly skilled or to those who drive and impact organizational growth. Other companies, even if they don’t say it aloud, use it as a term that divides and differentiates between job groups or types of positions - saying (or thinking) things like <em>“corporate and professional roles are<strong> talent</strong>….folks on the shop floor or in the field are associates/assets.” </em>(Ewwww; that’s brutal. But I’ve heard it.)<em> </em></p>
<p>Many organizations, however, simply lack a shared definition. Just because Recruiters are called Talent Acquisition Specialists…doesn’t mean anyone (even the Recruiters!) has a common understanding.</p>
<p>When I talk about <a href=""https://humareso.com/talent-strategy"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">talent (in the HR and business context)</a> this is my definition:</p>
<p><span style=""color: black;"">""talent encompasses an individual's unique blend of skills, experience, and personal qualities, enabling them to effectively contribute to an organization's objectives and achievements.""</span></p>
<p>Furthermore, TALENT, in the organizational context, refers to a collective of individuals - each with their distinct blend of skills, experience, and personal attributes, who, when working TOGETHER, <span style=""color: black;"">contribute positively to an organization's goals and success.</span></p>
<p>Why do I like this description? First and foremost, it acknowledges that a collection of human beings (such as in an organization!) is heterogenous. The resulting multifaceted kaleidoscope when we bring together people with varying talents is a <strong>whole</strong> … but we can still see, identify, and appreciate the <em>individual</em> elements.</p>
<p>Secondly, it speaks to an individual’s personal qualities. Innate or learned, this may include things such as propensity to learn, work style or communication preferences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong><u>Why it Matters</u></strong></h5>
<p>Once Bob, your new Sr. Widget Specialist starts on Day 1 (signs his handbook, completes Harassment Training and gets his newly delivered laptop set up), his TALENT JOURNEY begins in earnest. And will never stop until the day he <a href=""https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/jolts.pdf"">leaves the organization</a> (and beyond).</p>
<p>As an employer you have multiple opportunities to understand, recognize and celebrate Bob’s unique and exceptional skills, experience, and personal qualities.</p>
<p>Bob has certainly brought some innate tendencies with him; perhaps he’s a strong writer and dislikes public speaking. But that doesn’t mean he lacks desire to - or can’t - develop strong presentation skills. Understanding this, and providing opportunities for Bob, is directly at the heart of your development and performance management philosophy.</p>
<p>In addition, the promotion, activation, and alignment with your organizational culture (starting at the recruiting and hiring stage!) moves Bob along a continuum throughout his tenure. There are infinite opportunities to ensure Bob aligns with the company’s cultural elements including behaviors, norms, traditions and how navigating the organization will allow both Bob and the company to benefit from his unique talent. Oh - and important note: promoting cultural affinity is NOT a once-and-done (“we do a cool activity at New Employee Orientation!”) but should rather be part of every decision made and every employee-impacting and HR practice, policy, or process that is implemented.</p>
<p>And all these elements roll into Bob being an engaged (you DO define engagement beyond just doing surveys? right?) and productive employee. Using his TALENT <span style=""color: black;"">to effectively contribute to your organization's objectives and achievements.</span></p>
<p>Talent is not just a buzzword. It’s not just about sounding more current and modern by saying “we need to hire the right talent” instead of “we need to hire the right employees.”</p>
<p>Having a talent mindset starts with a definition of the word. A talent strategy is about understanding the interconnectivity of hiring and onboarding and development and engagement …and all the way along the continuum to offboarding. It’s about envisioning - and enabling - a journey.</p>
<p>And this <strong>talent journey</strong> is not just for Bob and his fellow Sr. Widget Specialists; Sally in the Distribution Center is also on a talent journey.</p>
<p>So get <strong>Sally</strong> a vehicle, give her the keys, and help her navigate down the road too.</p>","https://cdn.humareso.com/hubfs/Humareso%20Blog%20Posts-1-Defining%20Talent%20%282%29.jpeg","","PUBLISHED","false"

<p>Where is value placed? Relationships. There you go. That’s the end of the story. But wait. I can’t pay my bills with relational currency. I’ve tried. The mortgage lender sent me a letter saying as such.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>When a group of retirees all descend upon their dream community in India, they are met with the stark reality that money does make a difference despite the beauty of relationships developed. If you’ve not seen <strong>The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel</strong>, it’s a sleeper hit with an enviable ensemble cast. These retirees find themselves a bit underwhelmed, to say the least, with the state of the hotel and its manager. And while the characters develop a bond over their new surroundings, they are met with the reality that the hotel needs better fiscal management and investment. Despite how much personal growth each experienced in their unfolding relationships, they could not ignore the money matters at hand.</p>
<p>Our staff may find themselves in an analogous situation. In the past ten days, there have been no less than six different companies chatting with me about compensation benchmarking and pay equity analyses. The tension is there to affirm the appreciation of those investing in the organization’s success while trying to maintain financial stability and responsibility. If there’s only so much money coming in, as much as a company would want to give more to the individuals responsible for the growth, they will find themselves constrained to keep the purse strings tightly closed.</p>
<p>If you’re going to address this tension, the first and smartest step is to have the due diligence done to affirm compensation ranges and to develop a compensation philosophy. These areas will serve as the foundation to the <em>approach-to-money</em> building that’s being built. Without it, decisions around raises, bonuses, expansion, adding staff, etc., will all be arbitrary and capricious. Will it be based upon who we like best? Who has the loudest mouth? The categories are not based upon an equitable approach, but rather, one where power is unequally or unfairly distributed.</p>
<p>Bring in the experts to get these baseline pieces done. Once that happens, you now have a roadmap for compensation ranges for roles, levels in positions and staff budgeting. And this is where you may need to be thoughtful about <a href=""https://blog.humareso.com/you-gotta-be"">other types</a> of compensation if liquidity is tight. Areas of stock/shares ownership may be an alternative opportunity to allow others to be affirmed in their work without recognition being based purely upon a paycheck. What about other areas of benefits? Look at what you may already have access to and better utilize their offering.</p>
<p>As these approaches unfold, keep asking people about their experience with value within the organization. Ask how they perceive affirmation and recognition. Get a sense from the staff as to what chats are happening regarding compensation expectations. You may be surprised to see how much your team understands finances. Too often, we think “they don’t get it” without ever having asked them. Don’t assume. Ask.</p>
<p>Then get ready to share with your teams. They operate in the dark too much. It’s okay to say, “This is where we are. These are the reliable and verifiably researched ranges for the duties and responsibilities of the work being performed for each role. We use these ranges to ensure respectful pay and competitive consideration.”</p>
<p>It's worth mentioning that you may lose people along the way. Expenses have to be met for individual contributors. They will have to take their efforts elsewhere if the finances can’t support them. And while that may be painful, it is also something that smaller companies have dealt with for decades. The pool of resources is limited so if that person wants more, they’ll have to go for a bigger company and all that comes with that.</p>
<p>Affirmation of value through both relational recognition and compensation approaches are the responsibility of an organization. Gather the resources needed to get started. As Evelyn Greenslade (Judi Dench) says in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Best_Exotic_Marigold_Hotel""><strong>The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel</strong></a>, “We get up in the morning, we do our best.” That’s it. That’s what we do and that’s not so bad.</p>

<p>It’s difficult to look forward. There are obstacles in your way. Often, the largest one is looking backward. But how do you stop yourself from doing it? The answer is simple – you don’t.</p>
<!--more--><p>Telling yourself to stop looking backward is like telling yourself you don’t need to breathe. It’s a losing battle. As talented as you may be at holding your breath, you are going to eventually gasp for air. It’s physiologically hard-wired in us to breathe. Considering the past – events, mistakes, relationships, highlights – are hard-wired into our brains as well. We will recall moments along with the connected emotional responses. We’re thinking and feeling beings.</p>
<p>Our health in looking forward is found in support of how we look backward. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPleVKUGRY"">Daniel Pink</a>, for instance, shares research regarding how looking backward, even with regret, helps us to be better negotiators, better strategists, and have better response rates. It’s unlikely, however, that anyone has sat with you to categorize and to encourage a right approach to regret. We would rather avoid it. We tell ourselves to stop thinking about it.</p>
<p>Take, for instance, love. Consider for a moment that relationship that didn’t go as you had hoped. Or perhaps it is the family dynamic that hasn’t come together, whether as part of the family you were born into or the one that came along later in life. It would be understandable to resist and to avoid love moving forward. Based upon what I <a href=""https://blog.humareso.com/everybody-hurts"">experienced</a> in the past and how it made me feel, I choose not to allow myself to travel that road again. But again, we are hard-wired for love, for connection, for relationship, for meaning. These areas might carry regret for you, but to deny their place in your life would be detrimental to your emotional health as well as an exercise in futility.</p>
<p>Contextualize your history. Have you made mistakes? Did you cause pain for others? As difficult as it may be to say yes, it is vital to be honest with your review. Too often, we replay our memories to reform history. We want the account to have a different context. We belabor the frameworks to explain what happened, why it happened, how it was supposed to happen, and why what happened wasn’t our fault. Owning the past is an exercise in integrity; it supports our mental health. Yet, if something was not your fault, then don’t own it. Even if you’ve been accused of it, you don’t have to own it. You may have to deal with the consequences of it, however. (That’s a different blog!)</p>
<p>Sit in the truth of what occurred and how you may have made people feel, and then allow that to contextualize your path forward. You don’t live as a victim of that regret, but you can live in light of the lessons learned. Those memories don’t need to be obstacles, but instead, they ought to serve as milemarkers of your growth.</p>
<p>Goal setting your personal and professional development is likely influenced by looking back for gaps and missed opportunities. Growing from those observations rather than being mired down by those observations is where we lose ourselves a bit. We might find ourselves falling into a replay of events one too many times. This is not to minimize your hurt from past events; your pain is something to feel, to deal with, and to move on from. This may take some professional support, and it is worth the effort to do so. But counselors will tell you that staying in that past hurt will not help you nor will it hurt the perpetrator of your hurt. Gaining perspective on how to approach the look backward is a valuable tool.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is, however, that an individual must want to do this. Despite all the best, well-meaning advice and encouragement, it is the individual who decides to healthily look backward.</p>
<p>This year is your year to look forward differently. Get the tools and support you need to do so.</p>

<!--more--><p>It’s surreal to type that. My Dad was 73 years old. He struggled with pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema heavily for the last three years. Both of his lungs collapsed during that time. He was on oxygen full-time. He moved from a pulsating distribution of oxygen to a continuous one. He moved from a setting of 4-6 to 15. He then had to have three different oxygen machines helping him to breathe during the last six weeks, totaling a setting of 40. He struggled to breathe every minute.</p>
<p>I sit here reflecting on these last couple of weeks. My Dad was strong. He rebuilt engines. He remodeled kitchens. He raised various animals. He trained hundreds of people in secure business practices. He raised a family. And what strikes me is how many of those “He”s are “We”s. You see, my dad had me participate in all those tasks. I was his unwilling helper. We installed new valves in a Toyota using the kitchen table as a workbench (frustrating my mom in the process, ha). We took apart his parents’ kitchen, down to the studs, and rebuilt the entire South Philadelphia center of their home (we did lots of remodeling!). We took care of dogs, canaries, snakes, doves, turtles, fish, salamanders, finches, mice, quails, frogs, newts and many other species that I can’t remember.</p>
<p>Truth be told, I didn’t like any of it. And that was a cause of deep misalignment in our relationship. I wasn’t the son he had hoped for, and he was not the kind of dad that I thought I should have. We were not on the same page regarding most things. I felt a disappointment in him, and he dealt with frustration at not being able to connect well with me.</p>
<p>And then the grandkids arrived. When Kathy and I built a family with our three amazing children, Dad and I had something to connect on. My Dad was sold out for his grandchildren. He loved them and worked hard to let them know that. Truthfully, he was a much different person with those six kids (three of mine and three of my sister’s). My Mom and Dad loved being grandparents together.</p>
<p>My dad was a music lover. He was a singer for The Aquanets, a doo-wop group at the Jersey Shore. And while I cannot sing, despite the boldness with which I take the karaoke stage, I enjoyed my dad’s talent (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/JohnnyBaldino/videos/10220526727071925"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">like this moving gem</a>). I didn’t have to be good at the same thing to find common ground. We could enjoy music even though our skill sets were different. He was a performer; I was an appreciator.</p>
<p>My reflection leads me down a couple of paths. I was able to share some thoughts on <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/events/butfirstcoffee-grief7135743442852192258/comments/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">#ButFirstCoffee</a>. In addition, I know that there is common ground that each of us can find. It may take time, even years, and it may arise unexpectedly, but it is possible. That person who seems to be so different from you is a person. Connections are waiting to be found. I didn’t know what would ultimately build a bridge between me and my dad, but once we had it, we leaned into it. Each of us can do the same with those tougher connections.</p>
<p>This time of year shoves people together who may not normally have a reason to be together. Seek to find some common ground.</p>
<p>I am grieving my dad’s passing. Both of my grandfathers have passed and now my dad. There are less men in front of me. However, I have some great men coming up, like my son, Frank. I appreciate the connection we have in numerous areas of interest, of commitment, and of love. We found our connection sooner than my dad and I did. For that, I am exceedingly grateful. Funny how grief highlights gratitude. I think I will lean into that.</p>

<!--more-->
<p>This year, like those that came before, has continued to see an increasing number of HR leaders becoming integral to their organization's strategic initiatives. In 2023, more organizations recognized the strategic value of HR departments in areas like growth, innovation, and operational efficiency and we’ve specifically seen movement in how HR’s focus on the employee experience (EX) is increasingly being tied to business outcomes. Employee experience (EX) management lies in listening - not just surveying - and HR teams have been moving beyond traditional surveys to more holistic approaches, such as tapping into other feedback sources and demonstrating to employees that their feedback is valued and effective.</p>
<p>But what other significant changes has 2023 brought us in the workplace, amongst Human Resources professionals, and on the legislative and compliance front?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Workplace</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Hybrid Work Model: </span>The post-pandemic workplace evolved to embrace a hybrid work model, which combines in-office and remote work. This approach has been increasingly adopted by companies to both enhance employee productivity and increase satisfaction. <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/remote-work-statistics/"">As of 2023,</a> 12.7% of full-time employees work from home, while 28.2% work a hybrid model. <a href=""https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/telecommunications/connectivity-mobile-trends-survey/2023/hybrid-work-challenges-statistics.html"">Deloitte's survey</a> shows that 56% of employed adults work from home at least some of the time, with 34% maintaining a hybrid schedule.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">“Human” Leadership:</span> 2023 highlighted a growing emphasis on empathetic, adaptive, and authentic leadership – focused on improving company communications, teamwork, investing in employees, and encouraging feedback – and works in concert with hybrid work models and the aforementioned employee experience (EX). The need for leaders, managers, and line supervisors to be fully equipped to “manage” (and lead!) their teams with a people-first focus continued to gain steam this year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Focus on “Healthy” Organizations: </span>There's been a shift from focusing solely on employee well-being to a broader concept encompassing physical health, mental well-being, financial fitness, social health, and ensuring a safe workplace. A key component of this includes not losing sight of <a href=""https://humareso.com/diversity-equity-inclusion"">DEI&amp;B</a> (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging) initiatives and outcomes – especially with our evolving work models.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style=""font-weight: bold;"">The HR Professional&nbsp;</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Generative AI:</span> ChatGPT launched just one year ago, and this easy-to-use (and easy-to-understand) tool has greatly accelerated HRs interaction with Artificial Intelligence. In 2023, <a href=""https://blog.humareso.com/conversational-ai-for-hr"">Generative AI (GenAI)</a> made significant strides in transforming various aspects of HR, bringing both efficiency and personalization to the forefront. GenAI has improved employee self-service by offering more conversational workflows and tailored information, making systems more user-friendly and encouraging greater adoption among employees. In addition, Generative AI demonstrated its potential to increase HR productivity through the deployment of solutions like chatbots and automation tools, which can free up significant time and allow HR practitioners to focus on more strategic tasks rather than administrative work. In fact, one <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ai-tools-productivity-gains/"">study</a> found that business professionals who used AI could write 59% more business documents per hour…so just imagine how that can help HR practitioners with the day to day!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Skills and Upskilling: </span>Adopting lessons learned from the pandemic, HR continued to pay attention to upskilling (for employees and themselves!) to adapt to unexpected events. This has included enhancing employee experience (EX) management capabilities, which helps organizations improve key experiences (product, brand, customer, employee) and anticipate issues proactively. And, through the use of Generative AI, HR professionals have been able to facilitate development by helping employees understand their career opportunities based on their skill set. For instance, an intelligent chatbot <a href=""https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/generative-ai-and-the-future-of-hr"">powered by GenAI</a> can suggest potential job roles and necessary learning experiences based on an individual's skills and experiences.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The Legislative and Legal Environment</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Pay Transparency Laws:</span> In several states, including Rhode Island, California, and Washington, pay transparency laws were implemented or revised (revisions included covering employers with as few as 1 employee) while many other states and local jurisdictions, of course, have had pay transparency requirements on the books for years. In addition, in March 2023, the <a href=""https://norton.house.gov/media/press-releases/equal-pay-day-norton-introduces-three-equal-pay-bills"">Salary Transparency Act and Pay Equity for All Act</a> were introduced in Congress and, if passed, they would require all US employers to disclose wage ranges associated with all employment opportunities and prevent employers from asking job candidates about their salary histories.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Independent Contractors vs. Employees: </span>The legal determination of independent contractors versus employees remained a critical topic. The Department of Labor proposed a new independent contractor test under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), which emphasizes a multifactor, totality-of-the-circumstances analysis to determine employment statu, and in October, <a href=""he%20Labor%20Department%20has%20sent%20its%20final%20independent%20contractor%20rule%20to%20the%20Office%20of%20Management%20and%20Budget%20for%20review"">the Department of Labor sent the final rule</a> to the Office of Management and Budget for review.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Rise in Union Organizing:</span> Despite a slight dip in private sector unionization, unions won more elections to represent private sector employees in 2022 than in any year since 2005. As we moved into 2023, more employers realized the importance of focusing on employee relations, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/posts/humareso_outsourced-human-resources-services-humareso-activity-7056688309242114048-fkVt/"">proactively reviewing compensation and benefits</a>, and developing communication strategies. This trend emphasized the need for HR to engage in proactive employee satisfaction efforts and adjust to evolving workplace realities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">Whew! We’ve done a lot in 2023!</p>
<p>So what will 2024 bring? Keep your eyes peeled for our 2024 predictions – because, after all, you didn’t think we would let the New Year approach without pontificating about the future…did you?</p>

<p>I recently had a conversation with a friend who had started a new job as HR Director at a mid-sized company, She was PUMPED! &nbsp;The interview experience was top-notch and the Leadership team was excited to bring in a high-level HR leader (her!) to drive initiatives forward. Naturally they had all sorts of items on their “wish list” and the CEO, as would be expected, had even more. As the newest member of this visionary and forward-thinking team, the opportunities to deliver impactful and innovative HR promised to be endless. &nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><!--more-->So she started a list; (well, in reality she started the list before she had even been offered the job because she was so excited). Her initial planning resulted in an agenda including tackling day-to-day HR operational items to selecting new HR technology to implementing performance management to improving talent acquisition to rolling out succession planning to…well...you get the picture.&nbsp;<br><br>But as she crafted this working agenda for herself and her team, she found she was front-loading her self-imposed due dates. Everything seemed “urgent” (of course) and exciting (hurray!) so as she put pen to paper she realized she wanted to get ALL THE THINGS done in the first 2 quarters of the year.<br><br>Finding herself in need of a sanity check, she gave me a ring, we shared an adult beverage, and then re-oriented her HR plan back in the land of reality. &nbsp;<br><br>This was not, by any stretch, an uncommon occurrence.&nbsp;<br><br>Crafting an effective HR agenda and strategy can often feel like working on a 10,000 piece jigsaw puzzle. Alone. &nbsp;Especially in small or mid-sized HR teams, human resources professionals are jacks-of-all-trades; adept at handling everything from talent management to employee engagement, compliance, and culture building. But how do you set a focused HR agenda when you're tempted to do ALL the things …right now?&nbsp;<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Embrace the Big Picture, Then Zoom In</span><br>Start with the big picture. Understand your organization's goals, culture, and challenges. What does your company aspire to be, and how can HR help it get there? This broad perspective is essential, but it's equally important not to get lost in it. Then, once you've got the lay of the land, it's time to get real. Identify what's feasible and what's a stretch. Be pragmatic about what HR can realistically achieve given your resources and time constraints. And also remember two very important things:&nbsp;<br>• &nbsp; &nbsp;not everything that can be done, should be done<br>• &nbsp; &nbsp;not everything is actually (and truly) a “priority”<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Prioritize Ruthlessly</span><br>List out all the things you want to accomplish. Now comes the tough love part - you can't do it all. You must cut and re-order this “to-do list” ruthlessly. Prioritize based on what aligns most closely with your organization's goals and what will have the most significant impact. Find the sweet spot between ambition and practicality and be brutally honest about what's truly important. Does revamping the entire performance review process take precedence over introducing a new wellbeing initiative? Is it more important to focus on retention in a high-turnover environment before rolling out a new Applicant Tracking System? Sometimes the best strategy is to do fewer things … and do them better.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Build a Flexible, Agile Plan</span><br>Plans are great, but rigidity is not. Develop a strategy that's flexible and adaptable. The speed of <a href=""https://www.fastcompany.com/90833830/2023-predictions-business-change-corporate-purpose"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">change for businesses</a> is seemingly always accelerating<span style=""font-style: italic;""> (what will 2024 bring?)</span> and your HR strategy should be able to pivot as needed. Embracing agility means being ready to shift gears when necessary and not being so wedded to your plan that you miss the big picture. Oh, and by the way - the big picture is not your HR initiative or accolades for you and your team; the big picture is sustaining and growing the business and contributing to organizational success.&nbsp;<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Communication is Key</span><br>Keep the lines of communication open, not just within HR, but across the entire organization. Talk to senior leaders of course, but also wrap in other pertinent stakeholders including department heads, managers, and front-line staff. Share your vision, your plan, and, most importantly, the rationale behind it. Transparency builds trust and understanding. But, of course, communication is bi-directional so listen to feedback, be open to criticism, and be ready to adjust your approach based on what you hear. You really wanted to add pets to your Bereavement Policy but the CEO and CFO are opposed? Time to move on (for now). &nbsp;<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Embrace Technology Wisely</span><br>Much of your planning and strategy will, undoubtedly, incorporate technology initiatives. And while you will certainly want to leverage technology to make your HR tasks more efficient, be cautious. Assess what truly adds value to your strategy; there’s no need to fall for every shiny new HR tech tool that promises the world. Technology should enhance your strategy – not define it.&nbsp;<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Tap Into Other Resources</span><br>Often, when you’re listed as “Responsible” or “Accountable” on the <a href=""https://www.teamgantt.com/blog/raci-chart-definition-tips-and-example#what-is-a-raci-chart%3f"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">RACI Chart</a> (even if it’s a chart you share with no one but yourself!) all those due dates and deadlines can keep you up at night. This may be when you once again think about prioritizing (time and resource availability…remember?) and explore the feasibility of either adding staff to your team, <a href=""https://humareso.com/outsourced-human-resources"" rel=""noopener"">outsourcing</a> some of your current daily work, or <a href=""https://humareso.com/talent-strategy"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">partnering with SME’s</a> on any given initiative.&nbsp;<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Don't Forget Self-Care</span><br>In your quest to do it all don't neglect yourself; burnout is real and if you’re exhausted you’re not effective. Take time to reflect, recharge and rejuvenate, It is, after all, a marathon, not a sprint; persistence, endurance, and pacing yourself over time is more effective than rushing to achieve immediate results.<br><br>Setting your HR agenda and strategy in the context of wanting to do everything requires a blend of ambition, pragmatism, support, and flexibility. You can, more than likely, do ALL THE THINGS…just not all at once.<br><br><em>“In order to improve your game, you must study the endgame before everything else.”</em><br><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Ra%C3%BAl_Capablanca"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>Jose Raul Capablanca</em></a></p>

Learn why avoiding discomfort hinders us and how embracing it can lead to strength and resilience.","2023-11-09 13:30:00","2023-11-09T13:30:01.009Z","<p><a href=""https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/myopic""><img src=""https://cdn.humareso.com/hubfs/Humareso%20Blog%20Posts-17.png"" width=""2400"" height=""1280"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Humareso Blog Posts-17"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 2400px;"">Myopic</a> is a fantastic word, but it’s an awful existence. We have cultivated a society mired in narrow views and a “what’s in it for me” mentality. Of course, there are altruistic endeavors that we may pursue, but often, even in those, we do what is comfortable for each of us and only for a designated period of time. We want what works for us, whether that pisses you off is not a primary, secondary or third (I think 3<sup>rd</sup> should have some sort of special word here, like the first two) consideration.</p>
<!--more--><p>Does that sound too negative? Is it making you <a href=""https://blog.humareso.com/the-boxer"">uncomfortable</a>? Then you are helping to prove the point. Our discomfort is to be avoided. It is human nature to want to be protected from those engagements or interactions that cause us the internal squirmmies (yes, that’s a real word…at least right now it is).</p>
<p>It is not unusual to have employees come chat with management or human resources to speak about how some work or work interactions are making them uncomfortable. Now, naturally, there are truly interactions that are not only uncomfortable but may also be illegal. They may be filled with discriminatory or harassing undertones. Power may be used to minimize or discredit another. These are right out. Circumstances such as this must be addressed head on and rectified quickly, even if it does make HR uncomfortable (see what I did there?). As managers of people, we have a responsibility to handle well truly harassing circumstances.</p>
<p>However, for all of us, an uncomfortable situation does not make it harassment. The correlation does not have to work in reverse. You may work hard to avoid discomfort, but in the world of humans, that is a near impossibility. Our character development needs us to get better at navigating discomfort. It is a critical skill that is woefully lacking, and often overly influenced by our need for self-preservation and self-comfort.</p>
<p>Engaging with a co-worker who is struggling with how to communicate effectively or a subordinate employee who finds their lack of experience intimidating requires us to have conversations that might lead to emotional responses or an internal assessment of some sort. These kinds of responses peel back layers of protection which will feel deeply uncomfortable. We can encourage “staying the course” with those individuals through affirmational language and true relational investment. Walk the road with those employees. Offer support and strength to get through the discomfort.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left; padding-left: 0.5in;"">“The root of suffering is resisting the certainty that no matter what the circumstances, uncertainty is all we truly have.” ― Pema Chödrön, <strong>Comfortable with Uncertainty: 108 Teachings on Cultivating Fearlessness and Compassion</strong></p>
<p>This type of development only happens through exposure to the things we want desperately to avoid. Don’t underestimate the fact that for some people what you might find “fine” hits another as if on a precipice, one step from certain catastrophic doom. Advising someone to get over it is not as good as you might think. Providing some support structures through relational investment is the deepest way to affect critical thinking development as well as emotional stability coping mechanisms. We’re influencing behaviors and thinking; it is not likely going to be a one-time ten minute conversation.</p>
<p>Getting comfortable with the uncomfortable is a competency to develop. We are all in this to varying degrees so that should encourage us to be supportive of one another. Offering avoidance as the primary coping mechanism is not actually coping. Walk the road with people as you encourage them to step on the path. Both of you might be surprised to see how strong you are to handle the discomfort. As people, we often are surprised at what we can actually handle.</p>

<p>Can I be a true Philadelphian without loving <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hk-LYcavrw""><strong>Rocky</strong></a>? I don’t think so. The story of an underdog is a perennial favorite for any lover of gritty characters. We want to see those who work hard, who don’t seek attention for themselves, and who operate with a sense of values and compassion succeed. We want to root for them. It makes for a great movie.</p>
<!--more--><p>Are you rooting for the underdogs at work? Sylvester Stallone might be worthy of your adoration and support (I mean, of course he is), but is Mary in Finance or Chip in Sales?</p>
<p>Rocky was able to tap into our sense of opportunity, our desire for the “big man” to lose, and our frustration with how others manipulate the “little guy” for their advantage. Rocky plugged away for years, even getting to the brink of doubting himself. Am I doing the right thing? Rocky is challenged to dig deeper in his confirmation that he earned this opportunity, even if no one else believed in his right to it or his resolve to see it through.</p>
<p>Have you considered that Frank in purchasing and Rebecca in operations might be traveling the same internal struggle? Think about the years some people have worked at your organization. Can you believe that some are still waiting for their chance? They’ve been plugging away and hoping that the dream opportunity materializes. Not all of those who stay at your company are embittered and cranky just because they are older (that’s called age discrimination, by the way). Some are frustrated as to how overlooked they’ve been or how demeaned their person has been. There may be a story to tell that you do not know yet. Ask them.</p>
<p>Rooting for the underdog takes context. You have to know the tales of those who travel alongside you at work in order to advocate for their success and to encourage options for their victories. Adrian supported Rocky. He needed someone to believe in him without having that belief contingent upon what you can do for me. Too often there are ulterior motives for support of the underdog. Rocky experienced that, and it resonates with so many watching because they’ve experienced it, too.</p>
<p>One of the under-recognized truths about supporting the underdog is what it does to the person supporting. Adrian found her voice as a result of the well-received support towards Rocky. She was affirmed for her support, even though she didn’t understand why he fought or why he would want to be hurt. Adrian didn’t have to understand everything to be supportive. She saw that he could be great at boxing. And in return, Rocky saw that there was much more to Adrian than she realized. She was open to the encouragement.</p>
<p>Look around for the underdogs in your life. Who is near you that needs affirmation and support? It’s not hard to find them. Once you do, open a door for them. As Apollo Creed said, ““Do you believe that America’s the land of opportunity?... Well Apollo Creed does, and he’s gonna prove it to the whole world by giving an unknown a shot at the title.” Give someone a shot at the title today. And then just watch what happens to you in the process.</p>

We don’t like that luck part. It’s out of our control. I can make myself available. I can improve my skills in rapport development, full spectrum sourcing, and job marketing. I can put the dedicated time in. But catching someone at the right place, right time and in the right mood? That isn’t in our control.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The default for some recruiting pros and hiring managers is to overpromise in order to manufacture luck. Creative career mapping opportunities are well-delivered but based upon no actual history of offering such options to existing staff. A commitment to knowledge deepening is espoused, but often there is no time or budget committed to this endeavor. Warm affirmations regarding the company values are wrapped like a blanket around the candidate, but the existing staff have yet to find that blanket.</p>
<p>The lies that are told (yes, I am calling them lies) lay a foundation that requires an all-or-nothing response from the candidate. You’ve given them everything you can – money, culture, opportunity promises – and that sets up extremes. If the candidate accepts these conditions and joins the team, only to then find out rather quickly that no such opportunities are ready to be presented (nor may they ever be), then the quick departure occurs. Hiring managers return to scrambling to fill the once-again open role (usually citing the previous person to be a “just didn’t fit” employee) where they will return to promising experiences unlikely to happen.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the <a href=""https://blog.humareso.com/big-time"">candidate</a> calls the bluff and asks to speak to a current employee or two who are doing the same or similar work (yes, that happens at times), recruiters know they’ve been had. How could they let the candidate ask about these, at best, exaggerated opportunities to the current team? Won’t the staff finish that conversation with the candidate and march directly to the manager to ask when their developmental options will begin? The all-or-nothing is setup and it’s impossible to unwind.</p>
<p>Recruiters and hiring managers need to stand firm in following some basic principles of talent wooing:</p>
<p>First, speak the truth. Offer what is, not what you might hope will be, unless you clearly define the difference. It’s okay to say that, with the potential addition of this particular candidate, we hope to be able to expand our educational investment opportunities. We don’t have a timeline on that, but that is our clear hope, though not present today. Candidates appreciate the truth. They don’t want to feel snookered.</p>
<p>Secondly, anything that is offered in the interviewing process is up for grabs in the accountability game. A candidate should be able to ask when they might expect an update, should they accept a position with the organization, as to when these pieces hoped for are planned or are happening. Open-ended hopes will likely become closed-ended bitterness within the first six months of employment. By establishing timelines for check-in wrapped in accountable practices for delivery, the new employee has a clearly defined expectation to hold you to.</p>
<p>Thirdly, never underestimate the power of a realistic job preview. Offer the candidate to speak to employees who may not be part of the decision-making process. In fact, have the candidate speak to a champion as well as one who may not be overly enamored of the company (don’t tell me they aren’t in your company; they are). This is the most holistic view they can get. By putting those conversations forward as an option in the process, the candidate gets a strong sense that you’re not trying to hide behind something. Proactive transparency is attractive to candidates.</p>
<p>Promises aren’t the enemy; it’s the delivery and the follow-through. Can you confidently stand behind what you have just promised? Is it a real possibility or is it wishful thinking? You know which one it is; don’t lie to yourself, and certainly don’t lie to the candidate.</p>

  <p>Strong leadership is the cornerstone of a successful organization, but the traditional approach to 360 feedback might not be serving your leaders or your organization as effectively as you think. In this article, we'll explore the limitations of the traditional 360 assessment, and introduce <a href=""/leadership-development"">Reflect's</a> cutting-edge approach to leadership development.</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <h1>The Traditional 360 Feedback: A Snapshot of Leadership</h1>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>For years, traditional 360-degree feedback has been the go-to method for assessing leadership skills. It involves collecting feedback from multiple sources, including peers, superiors, subordinates, and self-evaluations. The idea is to gain a comprehensive understanding of a leader's strengths and weaknesses.</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <h2>While the traditional 360 approach can provide some valuable insights, it falls short in several key areas:</h2>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>1. <strong>Infrequent Feedback:</strong> Traditional 360 feedback for many, may be a once in a career opportunity for many leaders. Some organizations use 360s for cohort-based development, and a rare few offer annual opportunities for leaders to get 360 feedback. This infrequency limits a leader's ability to make real-time adjustments and improvements.</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>2. <strong>Bias and Subjectivity:</strong> The feedback process can be marred by biases and subjectivity, as respondents often struggle to provide constructive criticism, fearing repercussions or misunderstandings.</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>3. <strong>Data Overload:</strong> Collecting feedback from multiple sources can result in an overwhelming amount of data that leaders struggle to digest and act upon effectively.</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>4. <strong>Lack of Context:</strong> Traditional 360 feedback often lacks context, making it challenging for leaders to understand the root causes of their strengths and weaknesses.</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <h1>The Solution to Dated 360 Feedback</h1>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>Enter <a href=""/leadership-development"">Rhabit Reflect </a>- a platform that addresses the shortcomings of traditional 360 feedback and paves the way for long-term leadership success and organizational impact.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>‍</p>
  <h2>Here's how Reflect drives impact and improves leader behaviors, faster:</h2>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>1. <strong>Continuous Feedback:</strong> With Rhabit, leaders receive feedback continuously, not just periodically. This ongoing process ensures leaders are always aware of their performance and can adapt swiftly.</p>
  <p>‍</p>

  <p>‍</p>
  <p>3. <strong>Actionable Insights:</strong> Rhabit's analytics provide leaders with actionable insights, pinpointing specific areas for improvement. This data-driven approach guides leaders to focus on what matters most.</p>
  <p>‍</p>

   </div>
  </figure>
  <p>‍</p>
  <p>4. <strong>Self-Guided Development:</strong> Reflect partners leadership behaviors with learning content so leaders can take immediate action to improve their Habit scores by making small improvements, not unsustainable changes. Leaders can see how these little changes over time make a big difference in the way they’re perceived at work.</p>
  <p>‍</p>

I remember when it first began as a short on <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092469/""><strong>The Tracy Ullman Show</strong></a> (a phenomenal show in its own right), and now, with hundreds of millions of dollars earned, <strong>The Simpsons</strong> is an institution.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Do you remember how they were originally drawn? Where Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie began is not where they are now. Their figures have changed, and in many ways, they’ve changed significantly since Tracy Ullman. I have not heard much of a demand for them to be drawn as in the “good, old days” as we’re oft to say about other things. We’ve been okay with the evolution of characters. We’ve forked over millions for their likeness-infused merchandise so we must be okay with it.</p>
<p>Technology requires the same of us. We need to be okay with the evolution of tech products.</p>
<p>In the world of employee software, the alphabet soup of SaaS tools – ATS, HRIS, LMS, HRMS – along with the payroll, assessment, surveying and communication platforms make for quite a tech stack in some companies. Employees can feel overwhelmed as they negotiate through company software. Management can spend too much time navigating and completing tech-documented assignments. Executive leadership can fumble through dashboards and reporting. Finance can struggle with GL feeds and accuracy in labor distribution reports. Whew. It can make us hate software in about 3 minutes.</p>
<p>But is it the technology? Could it be us? I know, I know. I see the face you’re making as you think of the various people in your organization who are a mess when it comes to using software. Adoption for some employees is fraught with difficulty and frustration, both for them and for the HR team trying to help. But truly, it could be the software.</p>
<p>Are you still working on patching systems to speak to new ones? Do you get excited when you hear that a tool has an open API (you know you do) and think that’s going to solve it all? You might need to look at your tools more closely. Do they serve you well for today’s workforce?</p>
<p>I recently spoke with a business owner who didn’t want to update to a payroll system that allowed for the downloading of an app. He didn’t want employees to have such ease of use. Wait, what? He was concerned that these same employees could trick the system into giving them extra hours of PTO or mess with their pay. Deep breath. First, that’s not what happens. Second, who is the talent you are going after? They are looking for ease of use and ease of access. Just because it’s cumbersome for you, which it really isn’t, does not mean it will be cumbersome for them.</p>
<p>The evolution of tech is here, and it has been here. There are developers around the world updating systems, crafting new ones and sunsetting irrelevant ones. The life cycle for technology is usually vibrant. With AI and machine learning being as vital to the future of work as they are, how could a SaaS product ignore their fit? They wouldn’t.</p>
<p>Listen, if we have allowed the Simpsons to advance, we can allow a work product that we use daily to do the same. And if the product doesn’t advance, then we can look for another that is more advanced, more effective.</p>
<p>Have you given yourself permission to assess your tech tools? Budget the time and invite a few others into the mix. Cull the responses from the review into themes. Work with the team to decide an order of importance based on talent acquisition, performance management, career mapping and more. Look at all the functional and transformative areas that technology can influence and/or measure.</p>
<p>Assessing effectiveness instead of putting up with ineptness is a better use of your time, of the company’s resources and of the employee experience. <a href=""https://blog.humareso.com/strong-enough"">Build for proactivity</a>, not the usual reactivity that many get stuck in. Technology isn’t the enemy (breathe deeply and repeat that a few times). The enemy is irrelevance. The technology you use reflects organizational values and mission; make sure it works as it needs to. Remember <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWFF7ecArBk"">Radioactive Man</a>? “My eyes! The goggles do nothing!” Don’t be Radioactive Man.</p>

Reinforce values, affirm employee behavior, and create emotional resonance.","2023-08-29 04:45:00","2023-08-29T21:31:14.445Z","<p>Lots and lots of companies have mission statements – an explanation, in concise and simple terms, that defines the company’s reason for existence and its purpose. It’s often one of the top “to-do’s” that company founders or entrepreneurs tackle.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">While we often think of a mission statement as being in place to attract customers or grow new business opportunities, it serves many purposes. A mission statement not only expresses the company’s identity but can <strong>also</strong> guide organizational culture, entice job candidates, and provide a clear line of sight (for ALL employees) to the goals of the organization.</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">There are numerous ways to incorporate your company mission into your <a href=""https://humareso.com/talent-strategy"" style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">talent strategy</a> and across the employee lifecycle. Let’s imagine, for a moment, that we work at Acme Widgets with the following company mission:</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><em><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">“At Acme Widgets, we reimagine the possibilities for widgets, promote good in the world,</span></em><br><em><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">and operate with creativity, empathy, integrity, and innovation.”</span></em></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">So how do we link THIS to our talent strategy? Here are a few ideas…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;""><strong>Message differentiation for talent attraction</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">Job seekers have a choice when deciding where they wish to work, and the majority of <a href=""https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/blog/mission-culture-survey/"" style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">candidates will consider a company’s mission</a> and purpose before applying. So, while our group at Acme Widgets may indeed make the best-darn-widgets-around, the development of our employer brand, recruitment marketing strategies, and the interviewing and selection process should all align to the breadth of the mission. For these purposes, and for the assorted collateral and messaging we create, Acme Widgets should clarify “how” we promote good in the world and “how” our values of creativity, empathy, integrity, and innovation come alive.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;""><strong>Connect each job to the company mission</strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">We can also promote understanding and alignment for employees by incorporating the mission into both job descriptions and performance expectations. Let’s imagine Acme Widgets is hiring for an Accounts Payable Clerk – a position it can be easy to classify as a back-office job that is far removed from the actual “making” of our world-changing widgets. But if that A/P Clerk is not invested in the mission, they may merely go through the motions instead of understanding their role (if the bills aren’t paid…Acme can’t stay in business… right?) in the success of the company</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">In this case, in the section of the Job Description that references “Job Purpose” we can actually spell it out: <span style=""color: black;"">The Accounts Payable Clerk is integral to ensuring the financial integrity and transparency of our operations. With a focus on innovating for efficiencies, they operate with diligence and accuracy to support the responsible allocation of company resources. </span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;""><strong>Align performance reviews with company mission</strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">Effective performance reviews are a dialogue; a conversation that transfers information between an employee and their manager. And in amongst the discussion about performance, development and goals, there is a perfect opportunity to re-affirm both the company mission (that should be empowering people to do their best work) and the types of behaviors that align with company values.</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">At Acme Widgets we might put this into action by including questions such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">“Describe how Jane Employee has re-imagined one job duty over the last quarter.”</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">“What is an example of when Jane Employee demonstrated operating with integrity?”</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">Your company mission statement, designed for a wide-ranging audience from customers to investors to employees, reflects the soul of your business. It defines, very succinctly, why you exist and how you operate. It allows you to connect with people in both a logical and an emotional way. &nbsp;And never underestimate the power of an emotional connection; words and feelings will resonate with someone even after they move on to another widget supplier or to take another job.</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">Many years ago (let's just say it was before some of today’s musical artists were out of their cribs) I worked for an extremely mission-driven <a href=""https://humareso.com/hr-for-non-profits"" style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">non-profit</a> agency that had been in existence for 90 years. We conducted value-based interviewing. Our mission guided every decision we made at the leadership and board level. We kicked off all-staff meetings with a conversation about our mission and values.</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">And because we imprinted these things into <strong>all </strong>we did I still remember them: Compassion, Mutuality, Non-Violence, and Companioning.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">A company mission that lingers, years later, in the brain and heart. That was a pretty powerful way to power people.</span></p>","https://cdn.humareso.com/hubfs/Humareso%20Blog%20Posts-9.jpeg","","PUBLISHED","false"

But with passive sourcing, organizations can tap into the 73% of potential candidates who are open to new job opportunities.","2023-08-16 14:15:00","2023-08-16T14:15:00.625Z","<p>Finding qualified candidates is a constant desire of businesses. It’s like finding a needle in a haystack sometimes. How to best do it has been up for debate, but the numbers are showing a clear winner. 73% of potential candidates are passive job seekers. That means the majority of candidates are coming from an organization’s research to find and the consistent labor it takes to connect to a candidate who doesn’t know they’re a candidate…yet. This passive sourcing is the technique of the wise organization who wants to be proactive while maintaining the competency levels needed to successfully perform the work.</p>
<!--more--><p>But there is a second-tier statistic that really hammers the perspective home. Out of those 73% of potential candidates, 87% are open to the new job opportunity proposed. The vast majority of those sought out and connected to are not only willing to hear about the role, but they are most likely to accept an invitation to join the candidate pool for the job. The idea of “posting and praying” through Indeed, or the like, seems to pale in comparison to these stats.</p>
<p>How are you equipping passive sourcing to happen in your organization? Is it even a consideration for your team? Before you say yes, consider this: if you think that LinkedIn is your passive sourcing strategy, there are entire segments of the working population that don’t use or minimally use that platform with any regularity. It is most difficult to passively source someone on a platform of limited, if not no, active use. Think manufacturing, restaurant, retail, hotel and other industries. Not every pro uses that one platform.</p>
<p>What about the question of using AI to recruit and to source? It is possible, but like any product, it is dependent upon being fed information to activate robustly. When an organization does not use passive sourcing, whether at all or not very much, then those same novices are being tasked with building the input for any AI or machine learning software. Who is teaching your team in order for them to teach the robots?</p>
<p>Finding those resources to help your organization compete in a heavily passive market is vital for the success of any recruitment program. There can be no mistaking the utilization needed.</p>
<p>In the classic movie, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_(film)"">Josh Baskin</a> (Tom Hanks) wishes to grow up. His wish comes true, thanks to Zoltar. As he navigates this new existence as an adult, he gets a job and moves into an NYC apartment. Baskin is discovered by the MacMillan Toy Company owner (Robert Loggia) at FAO Schwartz. MacMillan is impressed and is sourced to come be a part of a new marketing campaign which ultimately leads to Baskin’s promotion to VP of Product Development. Not bad for a 12-year-old.</p>
<p>Mr. MacMillan went to where the best people would be – the toy store. He sourced from those experienced in toys and sought their input. Baskin didn’t know he would wind up with that role, but he was open to the opportunity. This is how passive sourcing works. It takes time, creativity and patience, but the end result works.</p>
<p>The struggle today is that many companies don’t have the time or the staff to engage with passive sourcing fully. It is difficult to just dip your toe into that pool and expect great results. A good idea without the resources to put into it remains a good idea; it just doesn’t become an activated good idea.</p>
<p>There are <a href=""https://blog.humareso.com/special"">organization</a>, and pique interest enough to get that person into the candidate pool. Easy? Nope. Time-Consuming? Yup. However, all research continues to point to <a href=""https://humareso.com/recruitment"">passive sourcing</a> as being the most pronounced method of recruitment to use.</p>

Learn how slow response times can impact candidate experience and employer branding. Find out why it's crucial to regularly check and optimize your systems to ensure a seamless recruitment process.","2023-07-20 15:41:40","2023-08-29T21:13:48.922Z","<p>“The patience of a saint.” That’s the sentiment I have heard from <a href=""https://blog.humareso.com/4-minutes"">candidates</a> who are in the pipeline for an open role. The delays in initial acknowledgment, screening, feedback, even in disposition are rampant. Yes, even in our world of automation. The systems are broken.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>At Humareso, we recently had the privilege of working with a client to assess the effectiveness in their recruitment process. Every emoji of SMH should come to your mind if you would like to know their response to the assessment. They had no idea that communication was as slow as it is. They did not know that initial responsiveness was lagging if it happened at all. They assumed their applicant tracking system (ATS) was firing as it should. “But we paid for people, for software, for stuff…how can this be?” Heard and understood, but a common reality.</p>
<p>Starting simply, SaaS products update (If software updating is a revelation to you, please schedule a time to speak with me 😊). Often enough, those updates can alter the flow of built communication. Some new button to check was added and no one on the team knew to do it. As such, those pre-built lines of communication sit inactivated. There have also been times when auto-email communication is sent, but it is the wrong one. It’s so awkward to call a candidate to do a phone screen and hear them respond with, “Oh, I didn’t think I was moving forward. I got an email basically saying thanks but no thanks.” YIKES!</p>
<p>We need not to assume systems are working well if they are working at all. Check them on a regular cadence.</p>
<p>Connecting with applicants is expected. If you’ve made the decision to post a role, then that comes with a commitment to respond to those applying. When recruiters don’t respond to someone who has applied, it should be of no surprise that those same applicants will take to the interwebs to share their experience. They will directly call out the <a href=""https://blog.humareso.com/special"">employer branding</a> being espoused by marketing. They may take to social media to name the names of the people who never follow up with them. They may be extraordinarily qualified for the open role, but because their experience was so poor, they self-select out of the process despite your late efforts to reach out to them.</p>
<p>Think about this. If you called a new connection, maybe someone you met at a networking event or someone you met at a bar after a long day at work (it happens), and that person took a week to get back to you, what would you think? Would that be off-putting? Likely, it would be. Maybe they aren’t as interested in connecting with you as you were with them. That would be a reasonable thought. And if that’s the thought of a candidate, that’s not a good look.</p>
<p>So, peek at your process. Do you even have one? Don’t laugh. Plenty of places do not. Or what about your communication? Has anyone read the emails that go out? Are they grammatically correct? Is the cadence of distribution good? And then, what about the phone calls or video chats? Is there a consistent approach to them? Are there qualifying questions asked of all? What’s the structure like?</p>
<p>Perhaps you think a week is more than reasonable to first address a candidate. Perhaps you are right. But what if you’re wrong? Is it worth the risk? The job market says it’s not.</p>

"Humareso Blog","Dreams","Dreams","en","https://blog.humareso.com/dreams","John Baldino","Life Paths,Performance","Dreams and aspirations are valuable, but they shouldn't define our worth. In this blog post, John Baldino shares his perspective on pursuing dreams, finding motivation, and embracing the journey.","2023-07-05 13:30:00","2023-07-05T13:30:00.800Z","<p>There has always been an appeal to the Academy Awards for me. To this day, I still envision myself holding that Oscar for Best Actor or Best Supporting Actor (I am not picky), giving thanks to those who have helped me realize this goal. It’s not because I want to be a mega-huge superstar but because I enjoy acting, and I know I have the talent for it. I can’t sing, so there won’t be musicals in my future, but a good dramatic role that I could sink my teeth into is right up my alley. Who knows? Now that I have put this out into the world, someone might offer me a spot in their next major motion picture! (I won’t be waiting by the phone)</p>
<p><!--more-->The truth is, many of us have unrealized dreams. Your dreams and hopes are special, even if they do not come to fruition. If the Oscar isn’t handed to me, my life is not a failure. I am grounded enough to know that there are more components to my life than one fantasy. While it would be fun, it won’t make me any more “something.” I am something now.</p>
<p>You are dealing with your own dreams. Are you “less than” because it hasn’t happened or happened yet? How are you defining yourself, and how are you defining success? The rub here is that our stability is oft influenced by visual reminders of what we don’t have. Spend any time on social media, and you will be convinced that your life is not where it ought to be. You aren’t as fabulous as the chiseled, fit bodies flexing on Instagram Stories. You aren’t as brilliant as those teaching LinkedIn Live webinars. You aren’t as “something” as what you see. The visual reminders can be debilitating.</p>
<p>Firstly, do you have the dreams you have because of the pressure from outside cues or is it because of your own internal motivations and desires? Authentic aspirations are exciting, motivating and captivating. That does not mean they are easy to achieve, but the motivations are genuine. Instead, if the aspirations are because of what you see, you may live too much in comparison. Unhealth can set in. Those pressured aspirations can set you up to fail.</p>
<p>Secondly, motivation towards your dreams isn’t about being preached to, but rather to be encouraged towards. There are those making a living by berating you into go-go-go mentality of achievement. Listen, I am all for some directed push. I can be lazy. I can grow tired, so I do need a few to remind me of the dreams I am working towards. Those relationships are dear to me. That’s a far cry from the half dozen podcasts you might be listening to where your existence is questioned at every turn. Those people should not serve to minimize or belittle you. If they rightly motivate, then stick with them. If you feel like a piece of crap after you listen, stop listening.</p>
<p>A final thought is that delayed is not denied. Today might be the day your dreams are actualized, but it might happen farther the road. Keep walking towards it. Again, it’s not a total failure if it never materializes, but you don’t know what might happen in the future. Resigning yourself to maintaining a “less than” frame of mind can lead to poor self-esteem and worth, even to mental health strains. You are still traveling along the road. You are not there yet. Keep walking.</p>
<p>In the past month, I have heard from at least a handful of people who are saddened by what’s not yet true of them. They are struggling to see the value in what they’re learning along the way. If this is you, use the sadness. It might jolt you into more focused activity towards those aspirations. The sadness might give you reason to review and to redefine, if necessary, those dreams you have. The sadness is a tool, not a state of being, in this perspective.</p>
<p>When I win that Academy Award, I will be thanking those who helped me to run after what I said I wanted to run after. I will feel satisfied with the accomplishment, and I should. However, the realized dream doesn’t mean I am done. There are other dreams to birth to fruition. I am an active being; so are you. And so are those you work with. We’re all running after it. It’s better to be a partner to as many as possible. Realizing this should influence your compassionate view of family, co-workers, even your boss! We all have dreams. What’s your dream?</p>","https://cdn.humareso.com/hubfs/Untitled%20%286%29.png","","PUBLISHED","false"

<li><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;""> How will you navigate internal dynamics and manage human emotions? For some existing employees, seeing a former colleague return with higher pay, a sexier title, and enhanced responsibilities (potentially amidst much fanfare) may trigger jealousy.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;""> You’ll want to lay sound foundational groundwork for the boomerang employee; while their institutional knowledge is a GREAT thing you don’t want them annoying others by constantly saying <em>“well this is how we <strong>used </strong>to do it….” </em></span></li>
</ul>
<h5 style=""font-size: 20px;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;""><strong>FURTHER CONSIDERATIONS FOR SUCCESS </strong></span></h5>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"">While processing a re-hire may be easy in many regards, for optimal ease and success think about some of these operational items: </span></p>
<ul style=""font-size: 20px;"">
<li><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;""> Make sure your policies are defined to accommodate returning workers. How do you count tenure or length of service? If someone comes back within x time frame, for example, do they come back in at the same PTO earning rate? Map this out, memorialize it in your HR policies, and plan for it ahead of time.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;""> Think though how much you are willing to negotiate – and is this consistent for ALL or just for specific boomerang employees? Will you offer WFH or hybrid arrangements? What do they now “want” from you that they got from the company they left to join? Are you able and willing to MATCH working conditions in the marketplace that perhaps you aren’t currently doing?</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;""> Make sure you have a robust and culturally aligned <strong>offboarding</strong> process; don’t be one of those companies that ostracize people as soon as they give notice.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"">Staying in touch with former employees, and doing so as part of your overall <a href=""https://humareso.com/talent-strategy"">talent strategy</a>, can be beneficial in so many ways; if they’ve had a great employee experience, they’ll continue to be your champions and brand ambassadors. And, if you’re <strong>super</strong> lucky they may, one day, bring their skills and talent back to your company as a boomerang employee!</span></p>

<p>The Carnival of HR, a monthly collection of blog posts that “travels” each month to be curated by a different “host,” brings together a collection of writers, speakers, profession-changing innovators and, the best part of all, HR leaders and practitioners who simply have something to say. The Carnival, and we may be biased, has laid the foundation for the various iterations of the greater – and incredibly global - #HRcommunity that has morphed and rejuvenated itself in the ensuing decade-and-a-half.</p>
<p>And the Carnival, beyond being a repository for up-to-the minute thinking that provides easy access to knowledge seekers, is first and foremost about bringing people together.</p>
<p>Under a big – and WELCOMING - tent.</p>
<h5><strong><u>Community | A Story </u></strong></h5>
<p>Recently, a member of the community, has been on a brave journey. Nicole Roberts, an HR leader and the founder of the People Solutions Group, was diagnosed with cancer (and fighting it!) at about the same time she experienced a lay off at work.</p>
<p>Laurie Ruettimann and Jennifer McClure have highlighted Nicole’s story – and her indomitable spirit. You can listen at:</p>

"Humareso Blog","A Different Corner","A Different Corner","en","https://blog.humareso.com/a-different-corner","John Baldino","Decision-making,Life Paths,Regret","Exploring the impact of decisions on life trajectories, drawing from movies and personal experiences. Emphasizes the importance of acceptance over regret, promoting healthier attitudes.","2023-06-09 14:50:24","2023-07-20T17:30:40.132Z","<p>What if one decision alters the course of your life? What if it’s multiple decisions? Chance encounters, missing out on a job opening, picking one bar over another to hang on a Friday night…all of these can limit or expand whom you meet, or they can change circumstances from which you make decisions. Not to give it all away, but yes, one decision can alter the course of your life.</p>
<p><!--more-->In the movie <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_Doors""><strong>Sliding Doors</strong></a>, Gwyneth Paltrow’s life vacillates between two different paths merely based on whether she made her train home from work or not. There is one particular relationship that hangs on that train ride. Ultimately, there is a convergence of timelines and relationships. In real life, you may feel that option doesn’t exist. If you miss it, you blew it.</p>
<p>Regret over these lost opportunities plagues many in our workplaces, our communities, and even our homes. “If only I had…” is a refrain that plays in the minds of many throughout any given day. It is overwhelmingly restricting and can cause some to spiral downward as they sit in that regret. No one is alone in these perceived missed opportunities, but the answer isn’t in the mourning of them.</p>
<p>Consider the benefit of what could have been thinking. It is a rabbit hole of rehashing conversations, reconsidering how circumstances should have played out, and rehearsing better responses. It is an endless cycle of lack. And once lack becomes the central focus, our mental, emotional, and physical health can trend downward.</p>
<p>Let’s affirm one thing to start – you are right where you are supposed to be. <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Let’s state that again. Today, you are where you are.</span> You may want differently. You may wish you had chosen wiser or with more intention, but here you are. Accepting that today you are where you are supposed to be is freeing. It frees you up to healthily look at what could be.</p>
<p>The shroud of regret blinds us to the whole picture and to the context of what is really in front of us. In 2016, <a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/06/regret-is-the-price-of-free-will/486077/""><strong>The Atlantic</strong></a> published an article that explored this idea of regret costs based upon one main premise – <em>“The tradeoff for moving our own pieces is that sometimes we make mistakes, and we have to live with them.” </em>Accepting this basic truth is the start to a healthier approach to what is and to what could be next.</p>
<p>Your life is not disappointing because you did not take one job over another. Early on in my career, I had the opportunity to work for <strong>TV Guide</strong> (if you don’t know what this is, I weep for you). Looking back on it, I should have said yes. I turned the role down. It did not have all of the things I wanted it to have. I was short-sighted and immature. I can see that today. However, I am not supposed to live in regret and disappointment over thirty years later. I ought to be able to look at it, see it for what it was (a learning opportunity), and then move on.</p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">If you notice these signs or others in your coworker, you should not research symptoms in an attempt to diagnose the issue or begin providing support they did not ask for.

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Remember that an employee’s mental health status is highly confidential and should always be treated with the greatest care &amp; consideration.

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Also, remember this is one more reason that intentionally cultivating connection in remote work is even more crucial than when working onsite. You must create intentional opportunities for social interaction to get to know people and build trust so you can recognize when difficulty arises and offer support.

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">As Mental Health Awareness Month comes to a close, think about those you work with and how you can build better connections with your coworkers and be a better source of support, no matter their level of mental wellness. </span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

"Humareso Blog","Bullseye: Hiring and Cultural Alignment","Bullseye: Hiring and Cultural Alignment","en","https://blog.humareso.com/bullseye-hiring-and-cultural-alignment","Robin Schooling","Blog,Culture,Talent Strategy","Hiring for cultural alignment, means ensuring both the organization and the candidate have all the necessary information to make an informed decision. ","2023-05-17 12:33:00","2023-08-25T17:24:21.603Z","<p><span style=""color: black; background-color: white;"">Hiring for culture “fit” has, in the last several years, gotten a bad rap. </span></p>
<!--more-->
<p><span style=""color: black; background-color: white;"">What started off as a means to determine if a candidate would work well within organizational boundaries, contribute fully, and thrive in their job became shorthand, in many cases, for the concept of “let’s hire people we like.” Admitting to evaluating candidates’ culture fit, even as but one of the criteria in the overall selection process, became verboten. </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: black; background-color: white;"">As well it should have. Because when hiring managers and HR professionals began to equate fit with sameness they were headed on a calamitous journey:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""color: black;""> </span><span style=""color: black; background-color: white;"">“She went to the same school as Bob did!”</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: black;""> </span><span style=""color: black; background-color: white;"">“I like that he volunteers for the community organization where our CEO is on the Board!”</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: black;""> </span><span style=""color: black; background-color: white;"">“You know she’s one of Mary’s sorority sisters!”</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: black;""> </span><span style=""color: black; background-color: white;"">“Oh yeah; we could totally have a beer with that guy!”</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""color: black; background-color: white;"">Now of course it’s disastrous for all involved when a new hire doesn’t mesh with the company. Perhaps their working style is a mismatch. Maybe their expectations for work-life integration and flexibility are not being met. It’s possible they want to work with team members who share memes all day and none of their co-workers have a sense of humor.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: black; background-color: white;"">So yes. Culture is critical. </span></p>
<p><strong><u><span style=""color: black; background-color: white;"">But What Does it Mean?</span></u></strong></p>
<p><span style=""color: black;"">Most of us have a clear definition of organizational culture; we understand it’s the collective behavior of the people who are part of the organization, as formed by vision, values, norms, systems, beliefs, symbols, and traditions. We know that culture affects the way individual employees and groups interact with each other - as well as how they interact with customers and other stakeholders.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: black;"">Hiring for fit, however, tends to favor the status quo in an organization. Suddenly, when you glance around your company, you see that everyone seems to be of the same age, has similar backgrounds and experiences, and they all rally around the same interests and activities. (“Hey! We have an axe throwing team!”) </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: black; background-color: white;"">And hiring for fit, even with the best of intentions, tends to negate all the good and important work your organization has done around creating a <a href=""https://humareso.com/diversity-equity-inclusion"">diverse and inclusive</a> workplace. A workplace where you bring together talented individuals with varied experiences and viewpoints. One where people experience a sense of belonging and connection – even if they don’t want to join your <span style=""text-decoration: line-through;"">bloody dangerous</span> award-winning axe-throwing team. </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: black; background-color: white;"">So prior to undertaking any activities to bring more people into your company, you’ll be well-served to actually <a href=""https://humareso.com/talent-strategy"">define and articulate your culture</a>; a deep and often soul-searching exercise. But this is the necessary so you can accurately – and truthfully - communicate with both candidates <strong>and</strong> employees. This does NOT equate to printing your company values on posters and hanging them in your employee break room. </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: black; background-color: white;"">It does, however, include asking yourself questions such as “are these stated values actually present in our workplace?” and “what sorts of things are influencing the behavior we see amongst our employees?” </span></p>
<p><strong><u><span style=""color: black;"">Culture and Hiring </span></u></strong></p>
<p><span style=""color: black;"">Now often, during the hiring process, the evaluation for cultural alignment is one-sided and proportionally askew. </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: black;"">The candidate, being a diligent sleuth, visits your company website where Mission, Vision and Values are listed. They may see some rah-rah messaging and pictures showing employees volunteering in the community, enjoying the annual employee picnic, and smiling at each other while seated around a conference table. They undoubtedly consume the standard propaganda:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""color: black;""> </span><span style=""color: black;"">“We work hard and play hard!”</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: black;""> </span><span style=""color: black;"">“We’re really like a family around here.”</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: black;""> </span><span style=""color: black;"">“We like to have fun!”</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: black;""> </span><span style=""color: black;"">“Flexibility is important and we back that up with our policies and benefits.”</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""color: black;"">On the other hand, the hiring manager, has a pre-determined mindset of how they intend to ascertain if the candidate will fit-in-with-the-team. They have a set of poorly-designed questions they’re convinced will find the hidden motivations and work habits of each candidate:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""color: black;"">&nbsp;</span><span style=""color: black; background-color: transparent;"">“Would you describe yourself as an introvert or extrovert?”</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: black;""> </span><span style=""color: black;"">“How do you prefer to communicate with your co-workers?”</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: black;""> </span><span style=""color: black;"">“How do you handle stress or tight deadlines?”</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""color: black;"">Hiring managers spend a lot of time gathering information…and nowhere near enough time <strong><u>providing</u></strong> information.</span></p>
<p><strong><u><span style=""color: black;"">Communicating your UNIQUE Culture</span></u></strong></p>
<p><span style=""color: black;"">But hear me out…</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: black;"">What if you, as the hiring manager or HR professional, spent a good bit of time at the early stages of the talent attraction process telling your candidates some of the reasons they may <strong>NOT</strong> want to come work for you? </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: black;"">I’m not saying you should make your workplace sound like the pits of the underworld (unless it is), but rather you should tell the 100% truth (early on!) so that candidates can self-select out of the process if your job, company, and expectations don’t match up with their needs, work style or interests. </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: black;"">So rather than saying “we work hard and play hard!” (that’s what’s on your website after all!) what if you told the truth: </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""color: black;"">&nbsp;</span><em><span style=""color: black;"">“You know Bob, here at Acme, Inc. we expect hard work and reward </span></em></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><em><span style=""color: black;"">accordingly at annual review time. We deal with shifting deadlines - often </span></em></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><em><span style=""color: black;"">at the last minute. That means you’ll regularly work 50-55 hours per week </span></em></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><em><span style=""color: black;"">and quite often a few hours on the weekends. We can’t guarantee any </span></em></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><em><span style=""color: black;"">schedule adjustments for long days or weekends; the work expectations </span></em></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><em><span style=""color: black;"">just come with the territory.”</span></em></p>
<p><span style=""color: black;"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: black;"">Oof (you’re thinking); no one will want the job! But I can guarantee you <strong>someone</strong> will want the job. The person who thrives on deadlines and adrenaline. The person who doesn’t mind long days or working on the weekends. The person who heard you say hard work is “rewarded” when annual performance reviews are conducted. </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: black;"">The person who will align with your culture.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: black;"">As for the candidate who doesn’t want to work in this type of culture? They’ll remove themselves from the process – which is precisely what you want them to do. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style=""color: black;""> </span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""color: black; background-color: white;"">Because ultimately, hiring for cultural alignment, means ensuring that both the organization <u>and</u>&nbsp;the candidate have all the necessary information to make an informed decision. </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: black; background-color: white;"">Bullseye.</span></p>

See how layering different tools is key to success.","2023-05-11 11:00:00","2023-08-25T17:35:16.969Z","<p>When you’re five years old, a wedding cake looks massive. It’s not to say that at six feet, three inches, these cakes are minuscule now, but as a young boy, I was a ring bearer for the first time at five years old. I got to do that job a couple of times, actually. And one of my favorite parts of it all was the dessert. The sweet table filled with various cookies, mini-cakes, and other sugary dreams had my already large eyes bugging out of my head. However, the many-tiered wedding cake was a full stop for me. Yes, please, and multiple slices.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I can’t help but think of that four- or five-tiered expression of sweet joy when I consider HR tech stacking in the workplace. And let’s be honest, it’s not because of the sugary sweetness of technology that I think of it. Rather, it’s much more about the stability of the cake as each layer supports the one above. Healthy, viable tech stacking in the workplace is built deliberately and supportively to the main functions to be achieved.</p>
<p>You may have <a href=""https://blog.humareso.com/mr-roboto"">tech stacking</a> at your workplace and not even know it. For instance, if you use an <a href=""https://portal.humareso.com/knowledge/applicant-tracking-system"" rel=""noopener"">applicant tracking system (ATS)</a> to receive responses to your job postings, whether resumes or applications, then that is step one in the most basic “workplace wedding cakes.” The widest volume of people interactions happens at this entry point. Consider how many people apply for open roles at your organization. Certainly, not all of them will become employees, but the repository may have four times as many applications as employees, if not a much higher multiplier. That’s a wide pool to manage to affirm candidate experience, company branding, and hiring manager accountability. There are automatic triggers in communication to applicants and internal stakeholders to the process that should be in place. The flow of information is crucial at this stage.</p>
<p>Perhaps your company adds a tier in employee assessments, whether job-related to process or culturally considerate to personality or motivations, to this tech stack. If you use screenings of various kinds, that layer would sit on the ATS. Those online assessments might get activated automatically because of a certain level hit in the candidate selection process, or perhaps you manually request them online with the information then flowing into the applicant process.</p>
<p>The next layer is added when an offer of employment is requested, delivered, and accepted. The <a href=""https://portal.humareso.com/knowledge/human-resources-information-system"" rel=""noopener"">human resources information system (HRIS)</a> picks up with that acceptance and electronically distributes the onboarding documentation. The new hire gets to complete the W4, I9, state and local required documents along with direct deposit, employee handbook receipt, and other pertinent policy advisements. For some of you, you are still doing all that was listed above in paper form. Oh, I am so sorry. There is an easier way, honestly, and it doesn’t break the bank to do so.</p>
<p>Many payroll systems function as an HRIS (or at least an HRMS – human resources management system) to electronically distribute and store employee onboarding documentation. That tier in the HR tech stack allows for monitoring in the completion process to be done remotely. With more organizations having employees work in a geographically distributed role, handling HR processes technologically from anywhere adds positively to the employee experience as well as affirms organizational relevance in the eyes of the new hire.</p>
<p>We’ve only built the first three layers of the “workplace wedding cake,” but there are other tiers to be added. The more robust of a hiring or employee life-cycle process, the more a company needs to develop a specific HR technology stack flow.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start with what you have access to currently. Look at the options and features that you may have as part of your current contract. Why aren’t they activated? What fears are there to do so? Who owns the activation – should it be someone in-house or do you need an external HR project manager to get it set up correctly?</p>
<p>Sit with your team and sketch out this cake. How many layers to start? (Parts of the process to handle) What flavor of cake? (Think technological representation of the values of the company) What icing? (Think organizational branding) What decorations? (Think who gets to be involved and what they represent about the company) And the best part might be the taste-testing (Think demos with a few technology vendors) so that you can see what options make the most sense for your plans.</p>
<p>Tech stacking isn’t scary, nor should it make you sad. It just requires some consideration, planning, and activation. These are the bones of what HR does regularly, anyway.</p>","https://cdn.humareso.com/hubfs/Humareso%20Blog%20Posts-7-Wedding%20Bell%20Blues.jpeg","","PUBLISHED","false"

Foster healthy work environments & prioritize well-being.","2023-05-01 17:20:41","2023-08-25T18:12:59.327Z","<p>Working hard and being thanked for it is appreciated by the recipient. Working long days, over and over again, even though thanked, is not a long-term employee engagement strategy. Employees don’t only want to hear “thank you” and certainly, their mental, physical and emotional health matter much more to them than appreciation. And if the 4.2 million people quitting their jobs per month don’t convince, then likely, not much else will.<br><br>At WorkHuman Live this year, there were many discussions around gratitude. WorkHuman is known for its commitment to appreciation and recognition of the employee contribution in the workplace. But the conference kept the conversation pointed to other areas of health and engagement. Specifically, in a panel hosted by Enrique Rubio of Hacking HR, the focus was about the human condition.<br><br>“People have become more comfortable in speaking about their mental health,” shared Michaela Leo. “The access to technology designed to break down boundaries in asking for help is as robust as it’s ever been. But there is still a challenge with having someone working from home all day. Some are finding that they are working much longer than they might if they were in an office location or worksite.”<br><br>The panel discussed the consistent problem of policy creation for such a dilemma. “It’s difficult to make a policy directing people who need to be in the office and those who never want to be in the office,” said Donna Louise Fitzpatrick from WorkHuman. “Whose policy preference wins?” And what does that do to the overall camaraderie of an organization when an “us vs. them” division is established? Clearly, the human resources department cannot wrangle this caste system by merely writing a one-pager for an additional staff email communication.<br><br>Knowing that there are organizations that have a mix of always onsite, hybrid and completely off-site personnel, the encouragement of the panel was to make strides in employee connection. There is not a window into seeing what each person is doing for staff. Even different departments ran into each other when working in an office suite in the past, but today’s challenge may not allow for such interaction. “The naturalness of seeing work that others are doing and then commenting in real time is lost when we don’t see each other,” said Fitzpatrick. And that is only getting more complicated when we onboard employees who have never spent anytime onsite (think pre-pandemic) and will never spend anytime there either. Where can those windows of observation be opened?<br><br>An initial suggestion is one of a mental framework. “Give yourself grace and space,” said Leo. “Without an understanding that there cannot be a one-size option for each contributor and that one team can’t have the solution for each employee’s desires, then pressure mounts and poor decisions are made.” The willingness to enter into collaborative discussions, focus groups or light surveys to find solutions begins to show the thoughtfulness of the organization.<br><br>“And don’t be distracted by the sea of innovation opportunities coming at you from business journals, magazines and web publications,” encouraged the panel. “All of those ‘best of ideas’ won’t work for every company.” Know what you need and why you need it. The influence of your staff should sit in a primary position as an organization decides how to create transparency and to remove roadblocks.<br><br>The mental strain that many staff, from the bottom to the top, are feeling is real. But if an organization is, also, committed to psychological safety, then we can fail without fear. Try some of the ideas gathered. Assess what’s working and what’s not. Use metrics to assess where the company has been and where it’s going with a clear basis for measurement. Failure is not to be feared; inaction is.<br><br>A final consideration from the panel is to be active. Fostering these conversant collaborations and then not acting upon any part of it shows the company to feign innovation. Talk is cheap and employees know it. Instead, use this opportunity to foster healthy work environments to, also, empower the human with transferrable skills for both work and life outside of work. The more a person is invested in holistically, the more likely that person will be to stay with the organization. That helps HR move beyond writing a policy and hoping it handles a situation to creating a coaching environment of sharing ideas, growing skills and fostering creativity.&nbsp;</p>","https://cdn.humareso.com/hubfs/Humareso%20Blog%20Posts-8-Wedding%20Bell%20Blues.jpeg","","PUBLISHED","false"

After all, the <a href=""https://humareso.com/talent-strategy"">attraction and selection</a> (and ultimately the retention and development) of employees remains top of mind across industries and geographies. With the <a href=""https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf"">unemployment rate remaining low</a> and employment trending up in some industries (leisure and hospitality, health care, business and professional services), many employers continue to scramble to attract and hire for open positions.</p>
<p>Yet, after all these years and years of collectively refining hiring practices, we still have opportunities to tweak. To improve. To make hiring less painful for all involved… AND to make it more effective.</p>
<p>At its most elemental, the act of extending an offer to the “winning” candidate, is often a poorly designed game; akin to awarding the trophy to the individual who has completed the obstacle course ahead of all the other participants. (Or, occasionally, is merely the only one remaining). It’s easy to understand how we got here. Numerous organizations - especially those with continual high-volume hiring needs and a lean HR or Recruiting staff – employ the same game strategy they believe served them well 2 decades ago.</p>
<p>But the world has changed. WORK has changed. Job seekers and employees have different expectations from their potential employment relationships than they did in 1985. And topping the list of things that employees want in their workplace is inclusion – believing that their contributions are truly valued. Furthermore, it’s critical for many that there be representation of different people across all levels/roles in an organization and that <strong>every</strong> individual can be involved, developed, trusted, and empowered. And when we remember this simple, yet simultaneously seismic, shift in what people look for in an employment relationship, we can see the need to, perhaps, adjust our approach to hiring.</p>
<p><strong><u>Inclusive Hiring</u></strong></p>
<p>Two sessions I attended at Workhuman LIVE highlighted, in my mind, the extent to which current employers can either help or hinder not only hiring efforts but also the effectiveness of nurturing a truly diverse and inclusive workplace.</p>
<p>Looking internally, and contemplating the contributions of current employees, can <strong><u>help </u></strong>in the very early stages of the hiring process. <a href=""https://www.threeearsmedia.com/"">Kat Kibben</a>, in their session, <strong>4 Ways to Delete Bias from Your Job Posts, </strong>discussed the importance of holding an intake meeting with the hiring manager. It’s during this intake meeting when crucial information is gathered that will inform not only the creation of the job post/advertisement but will also create clarity for finding optimal candidates. It’s NOW, during this conversation, that the HR staffer/ or Recruiter can ask <em>“When you think of the best person who has ever done this job, what are they like? What did they do well?”</em></p>
<p>As Kat pointed out, this question, does not (thankfully!) result in a laundry list of 25 meaningless bullet points; this question is, instead, designed to get the hiring manager to think about a PERSON – a HUMAN BEING. In other words, a current (or former) employee who performed spectacularly in the role can not only inform the hiring process but also provide clarity on what “skills” truly look like in action.</p>
<p>Conversely, there are times when current employees may <strong><u>harm</u></strong> the organization’s attempt to build an inclusive work environment filled with diverse perspectives and experiences.</p>
<p>Lauren Gardner, Corporate VP Global Talent acquisition with Microsoft, led a session on <strong>Building Culture: Inclusive Hiring Practices Every Team Should Implement Today, </strong>and discussed wide-ranging activities including the <a href=""https://leap.microsoft.com/en-US/"">Microsoft Leap Apprenticeship Program. </a> She also discussed how Microsoft dismantled one of HR’s most sacred traditions – the employee referral program.</p>
<p>The referral program was popular for years and years; employees who referred a candidate who got hired (they made it through the aforementioned obstacle course!) received a bonus. And who doesn’t like some cash?</p>
<p>But employees were, naturally, referring people who were “just like them.” Friends. Buddies. Former co-workers. Chums from school. To the point where sameness permeated not only the organization but, one can assume, entire departments. And this led to the exact opposite of what, from a cultural standpoint, the company wanted – a diverse and inclusive workplace comprised of people with a variety of skill sets and experiences.</p>
<p>So the top lessons I learned in just these two sessions?</p>
<ul>
<li>Hiring for your organization – and all the related processes, workflows, and activities – should never be static. It’s critical to regularly reflect, review, and adjust.</li>
<li>You should utilize “employee modeling” when it helps <strong>(“who does this job well and what are they doing?”) </strong>and avoid reliance on “employee modeling” when it contradicts your culture or has the potential to lead to unintended consequences.</li>
</ul>
<p>Peas in a pod can be tasty. They can also be bitter.</p>

Yes, Pluto TV and I are good friends. I get to watch lots of old programming (The Price is Right – The Barker Years is a particular treat), and I often have an episode with the Pacific Princess playing on a Sunday afternoon while I prep for the week ahead. The guest stars are absolutely amazing. Don’t scoff. Take a peek at the long list of A-listers that rubbed elbows with the D-Listers. On this particular episode, Eddie Mekka played a high school friend of “Julie, Your Cruise Director” (it’s a requirement to say it together) who, within 30 seconds of being on the ship, sees the love of his life. He didn’t speak to her. He hadn’t heard her voice. He just saw her from afar and decided that she was “the one.” And, of course, in true Love Boat fashion, that three-day cruise, after some fumbling and lying, proved his wish to be granted. He and Audrey Landers left the boat with plans to marry. See? Easy.<br><br>It got me thinking about how we approach career opportunities in a similar fashion. We look to fall in love and to do so quickly.<br><br>Be honest. Haven’t you walked into an interview or logged onto your video appointment hoping to get “that feeling?” It’s not to say that you don’t care about the work, the community or the structure of the organization. It’s just that you might want to get the butterflies in your belly first.<br><br>Walking in holistically prepared for that interview (throughout the whole process, actually) is likely the best way to avoid a sensory-biased decision-making process. Have a plan of engagement which includes your perspectives and questions based upon some legwork you’ve done regarding the company’s work, history, reviews, cultural insights, etc. Remember, this is an interview for the organization as much as it is for you.<br><br>I am in the throws of some hiring now. Truthfully, I am keeping track of the approach. Less than 8% of those I am interviewing ask any questions…at all. I specifically leave time towards the end of the interview to invite the asking of anything about the organization. More than 90% of the time, the interviewee says something like, “Thank you, but I don’t have any questions. I just want to say how excited I am about this opportunity.”<br><br>Look, I love that people want to work with the awesome team that’s been assembled (Avengers!), but there should be things about the company that you would want to know. Ask about the organization’s commitment to excellence in its work. Ask about how an equitable environment has been created and fostered (and if it’s not yet there, ask about what the hold up is). Ask about why this role is open. If it’s an additional role, ask how it was determined that this was the right time to add. If it’s a replacement role, ask why the previous employee moved out of the job. Ask about the manner with which investment in the persons of the company are made, not just in benefits (certainly including this, though), but also in areas of competency development, work-life integration, community involvement and the like.<br><br>This prep work will balance out the emotional desire to “just know” that this is the right place for your next role. There is nothing wrong with enjoying a stroll around the deck in the moonlight while wearing a chiffon gown. However, the engine room, the laundry room and the staff quarters are just as important to get a true view if you’re planning on investing yourself on that ship.</p>

<p>Of course the biggest story out of this year’s NCAA Men’s tournament was how all <a href=""https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/march-madness-2023-all-no-1-seeds-eliminated-before-elite-eight-for-first-time-in-ncaa-tournament-history/"">No.1 seed teams were eliminated</a> before the Elite Eight play (first time in history that happened). The second biggest story, IMO, has been the collective sounds of crying and gnashing of teeth as armchair coaches, workplace bracket-players, and even hard-core gamblers found themselves with busted brackets. (fun fact: according to the NCAA there has never been a <a href=""https://www.nbcsports.com/chicago/has-there-ever-been-perfect-ncaa-tournament-bracket"">verified perfect bracket</a>.

<p><span style=""font-size: 18px;"">Alas, as I've often learned when lifting the hood of that souped-up ""hiring machine,"" there are some engine parts in need of a tune-up. The warning signs (""check engine?"") may include:&nbsp;</span></p>

</ul>
<p><span style=""font-size: 18px;"">The key to successful hiring is making sure that every component along the continuum is fully aligned - from workforce planning <i>(""Should we even open this requisition? What </i><strong><i>are</i></strong><i> the business-critical skills we need at this time?"")</i> all the way through to offer accepted/employee pre-boarding.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 18px;"">But if you need to make some adjustments to your hiring process, here are a few areas in which to run some initial internal diagnostics:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 18px;""><strong>Hiring Criteria</strong>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px;""><span style=""font-size: 18px;"">Make sure that you have well-defined hiring criteria for each open role including the requisite skills and behavioral competencies/attributes required. You may find a simple job review, update, and job description re-write suffices. If hiring for a job that is rarely available - or a position currently held by a long-tenured incumbent - a more robust job analysis may be appropriate. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 18px;""><strong>Data Gathering </strong>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px;""><span style=""font-size: 18px;"">Formulate a plan for HOW you'll gather information from candidates; after all, you'll be accumulating lots of data. For optimal results, structure your data gathering (including asking applicants the same questions) to provide for both legal compliance and consistency. After all – it's impossible to evaluate 10 applicants if you have 10 varied sets of data and incongruous information!&nbsp;</span><br><span data-contrast=""auto"" style=""font-size: 18px;""></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 18px;""><strong>Manager Readiness</strong>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px;""><span style=""font-size: 18px;"">Managers play the most crucial role in the process; they are, of course, the individuals making the hiring decisions. In addition to their involvement in determining hiring criteria, training managers on HOW to interview is critical. (Ideally, this training goes well beyond a handout listing ""questions not to ask."") &nbsp;</span><br><span data-contrast=""auto"" style=""font-size: 18px;""></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 18px;""><strong>Parameters for Decision Making</strong>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px;""><span style=""font-size: 18px;"">Finally, there should be a standardized manner by which hiring decisions (""is this applicant a 'go' or 'no-go?'"") are made. Instituting a candidate-assessment model that enables fair evaluation and rating of applicants will both reduce manager-bias and decrease the likelihood of poor hiring decisions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 18px;"">Implementing a <a href=""https://humareso.com/talent-strategy"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">well-designed hiring process</a> is a start but following a maintenance schedule (and committing to regular adjustments and tune-ups!) keeps the engine running smoothly.&nbsp;</span></p>

Some skeptics argue that its implementation may be hindered by privacy and data security concerns. </span><a href=""https://textio.com/blog/chatgpt-writes-valentines/102332725392"" style=""background-color: #ffffff;""><span style=""color: #404040;"">Some have even measured its bias</span></a><span style=""color: #404040;""> as, let's be real, its core data source is years and years of the internet. Others suggest that it may need to be able to replace the human element of HR fully. Despite these challenges, it's essential to recognize that AI-powered chatbots like ChatGPT are continuously evolving and improving and will undoubtedly play an increasingly significant role in the future of HR operations. However, it's also essential to acknowledge that any changes brought about by ChatGPT will take time. HR professionals must navigate these challenges with care and caution to ensure that their organizations reap the maximum benefits of this technology. </span><span style=""color: #404040;"">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #404040; background-color: #ffffff;"">By harnessing the power of artificial intelligence and natural language processing, ChatGPT has the potential to revolutionize HR operations by streamlining processes, improving employee experiences, and driving better business outcomes. Its ability to process vast amounts of data, generate insights and automate various tasks can help organizations optimize their HR processes and improve employee experiences. </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #404040; background-color: #ffffff;"">The integration of AI into HR operations can provide significant benefits to organizations. Chat GPT can help organizations optimize their HR processes and improve the employee experience by automating routine tasks, generating insights, and providing personalized support. As such, organizations should consider the potential benefits of Chat GPT and explore how it can be integrated into their HR operations.</span></p>
<p>It can also backfire in an instant. But I'll be Debbie Downer another day and focus solely on what this AI is all about, as not everyone understands the concept of conversational AI and its infamous first-to-market success story.</p>
<h4><!--more--></h4>
<h4><span style=""color: #404040; background-color: #ffffff;"">Prereq: WTF is GPT?</span></h4>
<p><span style=""color: #404040; background-color: #ffffff;"">ChatGPT, or Generative Pre-trained Transformer, is a state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) model developed by OpenAI that uses a transformer-based neural network to generate human-like responses to natural language inputs. This makes it stand out from other AI bots as it is specifically designed to process and understand human language and generate responses that are contextually appropriate and relevant. Additionally, ChatGPT's training data consists of an enormous amount of diverse content from the internet, which allows it to produce a wide range of responses to a wide range of inputs. This makes ChatGPT incredibly versatile and adaptable, and its ability to understand and generate human-like responses has made it a powerful tool for a wide range of applications, including in the realm of human resources.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #404040; background-color: #ffffff;"">Some people may have reservations about ChatGPT's ability to fully replace the human element of HR, as it may be perceived as impersonal or insufficiently empathetic. Others may be concerned about potential job loss or the need to learn new skills to adapt to the technology. But no matter the outcome, it's safe to say that its impact on the evolution of HR will be on par with that of COVID-19. Maybe greater.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #404040; background-color: #ffffff;"">With the help of some friends, let's dig into 5 areas where I see ChatGPT disrupting and evolving the HR tech landscape.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style=""color: #404040; background-color: #ffffff;"">Recruitment</span></h2>
<p><span style=""color: #404040; background-color: #ffffff;"">The initial stages of the recruitment process are often time-consuming and resource-intensive, involving screening resumes and shortlisting candidates. However, Chat GPT can automate these processes and significantly reduce the workload of HR teams.</span></p>

<p><span style=""color: #404040; background-color: #ffffff;"">Using natural language processing (NLP), Chat GPT can analyze and understand the content of resumes, allowing it to screen candidates for specific skills and qualifications. It can also identify any gaps in the candidate's experience or education and flag any potential issues for further review by HR teams. This can help to streamline the recruitment process and ensure that only the most qualified candidates are shortlisted for further consideration.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #404040; background-color: #ffffff;"">In addition to screening resumes, Chat GPT can also be used to conduct initial interviews with candidates. Using NLP, Chat GPT can analyze the candidate's responses to interview questions and assess their fit for the job and organization based on their communication skills, personality traits, and cultural fit. It can also analyze the tone and sentiment of their responses, helping to identify any red flags or areas for further investigation.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #404040; background-color: #ffffff;"">To implement Chat GPT into the recruitment process, HR teams need to provide the language model with a dataset of job descriptions, company values, and a list of skills and qualifications for the job. This allows Chat GPT to learn the specific requirements of the job and organization, and use this knowledge to screen resumes and conduct interviews.</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;""><span style=""color: #404040;"">There are ridiculous benefits of using Chat GPT to automate the initial stages of the recruitment process. Firstly, it can significantly reduce the time and resources required to screen resumes and shortlist candidates, freeing up HR teams to focus on more strategic activities. Secondly, it can drastically reduce bias in the recruitment process, ensuring that candidates are selected based on their skills and qualifications rather than any preconceived notions or biases. Finally, it can provide a more seamless and efficient experience for candidates, improving their overall impression of the organization.</span><span style=""color: #404040;"">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #404040; background-color: #ffffff;"">This leads to a powerful tool for automating the initial stages of the recruitment process. By screening resumes and conducting initial interviews using NLP, it can help to streamline the recruitment process, reduce bias, and improve the candidate experience. As such, organizations should consider the potential benefits of Chat GPT and explore how it can be integrated into their recruitment process.</span></p>

<h2><span style=""color: #404040; background-color: #ffffff;"">Employee Engagement</span></h2>
<p style=""font-size: 16px; text-align: center;""><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;""><em><span style=""color: #404040;"">""What are employees REALLY talking about? How are they spending their time? How are they learning new skills? With whom do individuals collaborate?&nbsp; The use of AI means one can analyze, at a high data-driven level, employee sentiment and behavior allowing an organization to uncover themes and trends that the majority of employees find either fulfilling – thus propelling their performance and improving their employee experience! – or lacking.""</span></em></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: center; font-size: 14px;""><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;""><em><span style=""color: #404040;"">—</span></em><span style=""color: #404040;""> Robin Schooling, Director of Talent Strategy, Humareso</span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #404040; background-color: #ffffff;"">Effective employee engagement is crucial to the success of any organization. It can improve productivity, reduce turnover, and enhance the overall employee experience. However, traditional methods of gathering feedback and measuring employee engagement can be time-consuming and may not provide accurate insights. Chat GPT can be used to create personalized and interactive conversations with employees to better understand their needs and gather feedback, as well as conduct pulse surveys to collect data on employee engagement.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #404040; background-color: #ffffff;"">Imagine the ability to create personalized and interactive conversations with employees through chatbots or virtual assistants. By analyzing employee data, such as performance metrics, learning preferences, and feedback, Chat GPT can provide employees with relevant and targeted information to support their development and career progression. It can also assist employees in navigating company policies, benefits, and other relevant information. These personalized conversations can enhance employee engagement and improve the overall employee experience.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #404040; background-color: #ffffff;"">Chat GPT can also be used to gather feedback from employees in a more efficient and effective way. By engaging employees in personalized conversations, Chat GPT can gather feedback on specific topics, such as job satisfaction, training needs, or career progression. It can also provide employees with a platform to express their opinions and share their thoughts and ideas, which can help to foster a culture of open communication and trust. This feedback can be used to identify areas for improvement, address employee concerns, and drive HR strategies.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #404040; background-color: #ffffff;"">In addition to personalized conversations, Chat GPT can also be used to conduct pulse surveys to measure employee engagement. Pulse surveys are short and frequent surveys that can be used to collect data on employee engagement and other key metrics. By analyzing the data collected through pulse surveys, HR teams can identify trends, track progress, and identify areas for improvement. This data can be used to develop targeted HR strategies and initiatives to improve employee engagement and the overall employee experience.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #404040; background-color: #ffffff;"">AI then becomes a powerful tool for improving employee engagement and enhancing the overall employee experience. By creating personalized and interactive conversations with employees, gathering feedback, and conducting pulse surveys, Chat GPT can provide HR teams with valuable insights into employee needs and preferences. This can help organizations to optimize their HR processes, address employee concerns, and improve employee engagement.

By analyzing individual learning preferences, Chat GPT can generate personalized training recommendations for each employee. These recommendations can be delivered in the form of interactive e-learning modules, videos, or other formats, tailored to the individual learning style of each employee. This can help to ensure that employees are engaged in the learning process and are able to apply the knowledge they acquire to their work.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #404040; background-color: #ffffff;"">That's the golden ticket every learning management system has tried to sell you in the last 5 years and failed. What if it's now within reach? HR teams can develop personalized learning experiences for employees. These experiences can be tailored to the specific needs and preferences of each employee, providing a more engaging and effective learning experience. By using interactive chatbots and other technologies, Chat GPT can create a conversational and personalized learning experience, allowing employees to learn in a way that suits their individual learning styles.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #404040; background-color: #ffffff;"">The end product can be a valuable tool for creating personalized learning experiences for employees.

By that era, of course, they had long stopped setting up their own Big Top on the outskirts of town and, instead, circus patrons headed to the local arena. Growing up in Milwaukee, I was lucky to live through the era of the Great Circus Parade (held 30 times between 1963 and 2009). Alongside the bands, Shriners and dancing groups, the parade featured hundreds of clowns, wagons, animals and antique circus vehicles. These items were transported the 200 miles from Baraboo, WI to Milwaukee on the ""circus train"" (which people lined up to watch along the route). Upon arrival, the ""circus"" would set up in a park on the shores of Lake Michigan and hold shows in an actual real-life outdoor Big Top.<br><br>I loved it.<br><br>Those days, of course, are long gone. Other types of entertainment became more popular, and circuses became relics from some distant, dusty past.<br><br>But the circus, like it's closely related form of entertainment, the carnival, still exists to some degree (although they've gotten much better with animal treatment!). Both circuses and carnivals bring their events TO people. The Carnival Barker and the Circus Ringleader strive to be entertaining. And, most importantly, they work to assemble enticing acts - whether on a fairground field or under the Big Top.<br><br>So, with a bit of a flourish (no sleight of hand), we present this edition of the Carnival of HR.

"Humareso Blog","You're So Vain: The Egotism in Performance Appraisals","You're So Vain: The Egotism in Performance Appraisals","en","https://blog.humareso.com/performance-appraisals","John Baldino","Performance,management","Discover how effective performance management can combat narcissistic tendencies in employees and build superior performance. ","2023-02-21 13:32:30","2023-02-21T19:12:58.305Z","<p style=""font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;"">For fans of 30 Rock, Jenna Maroney was the epitome of self-centeredness. She found herself often at an emotional crossroads when her performance on “TGS” was deemed less than stellar by her colleagues, writers or directors. Brilliantly played by Jane Krokowski, Jenna was the pinnacle of conceit, self-absorption and frailty. In many ways, Jenna is all of us when it comes to critique.<br><br>Is my ego so fragile that when I “meet expectations” on a performance appraisal, I sit in full disbelief and disgust in the obvious underappreciation by my employer? For the modern American worker, in particular, you bet your bippy that’s how it is. And it’s been this way for some time.<br><br>As a country, the United States has struggled with its own narcissistic tendencies for decades; Americans think better of themselves, today, by default. Daniel Altman (2011) wrote:<br><br>Psychologists have been tracking narcissism through surveys of American college students since the late 1970s, and levels of it—often measured as a lack of empathy—have never been higher, according to Sara Konrath, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan’s Research Center for Group Dynamics. “If you look at the levers in society, almost all of them are pushing us towards narcissism,” she says. These levers go beyond Twitter feeds and Facebook pages, which offer endless opportunities for self-admiration. They also include advertising that tells consumers “You’re worth it” and reality-TV shows that turn regular people against each other in a battle for celebrity. (Altman)<br><br>It’s no wonder that, in the American workforce, being average is insulting. Even if the manager delivering the news is not presenting it in a negative tone, the rating of “Meets Expectations” is enough to trigger a poor response. At the onset, a wise manager needs to know what he/she/they are dealing with amongst the team. Whether it’s from historical data or behavioral assessment, a manager should have measured responses to know what’s coming.<br><br>And secondly, managers need to be ready to define and to justify an effective performance management system. These systems are all about building superior performance. The necessary piece is to understand, first for yourself as manager, what an effective performance management system is. For far too many, performance management is equal to performance appraisal. The annual or semi-annual performance assessment form is the bane of most managers’ existence. The completion of the form becomes the ultimate goal with very little measured thought or metrics-based assessment making its way onto the appraisal. Who has time for such things? Am I right?<br><br>Well, that’s why we wind up with narcissistic, overly self-impressed employees. We have not taught them any better. Effective performance management is about the long view with consistent feedback to affirm, rebuke and course correct. Without direction, anyone’s eyes would look to self, first, and then to a comparison to those around. If I<br><br>perceive that I am better than most of my colleagues (which most do), then I will only be satisfied with an “Exceeds Expectations” on an appraisal. An employee needs direction in what is being measured, why it’s being measured, how it’s being measured and for what overall purpose does that vein of work provide. Effectiveness cannot be just for the task, but for the overall goals of the team, division and organization. Effective is moving things forward.<br><br>I’ve known people who were great at tying a cherry stem into a knot with only their tongues. I have had successful tries, but not all of them were winners. A couple of friends of mine were incredibly talented at performing this feat. I could count on them every time. Think about the tasks that some of your employees can do successfully almost every time. Does that success mean effectiveness? I am not sure what overall goal tying cherry stems with your tongues would push a team towards (keep those thoughts in your head!), but if I just affirm that feat, I am causing performers to think more of that achievement than they ought.<br><br>However, if there are tasks that do build towards the whole, then have a right metric in place to affirm those contributions. Herein is where the “we’ve always done it this way” attitude can take hold. If someone is performing the same way but is never held accountable to a new system for success measurement, then you should not be upset with that employee. It’s management’s fault. Explain why the completion of that tasks isn’t enough anymore. Teach, train, coach and mentor. Effectiveness is not ready in 24 hours. It’s more a slow cooker when changing previous constructs. Keep the low heat going and stir regularly.&nbsp;</p>

Really.","en","https://blog.humareso.com/my-ceo-just-asked-if-i-was-really-in-the-hospital","Jamie Aquila","Mental Health,human resources,management","A short story of a CEO that crossed a boundary that he shouldn't have.","2023-02-14 18:38:24","2023-02-14T18:38:24.668Z","<p style=""font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;"">Names have been altered to protect the innocent, about someone I may or may not know.</p>
<!--more-->
<p style=""font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;"">Once upon a time, there was a CEO named Jack who ran a successful business. One of his favorite employees, Sarah, had to take a sudden leave of absence due to a serious illness that required her to be hospitalized.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;"">Although Sarah had provided the company with the necessary documentation, Jack couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off. He couldn't understand how someone who was apparently so ill could still be able to answer her phone and emails.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;"">Feeling suspicious, Jack decided to call Sarah while she was still in the hospital to give support, but also inquire about her condition. But Sarah, who was already feeling anxious and stressed about her illness, was taken aback by Jack's call. She felt like her privacy was being invaded, and she couldn't understand why her boss would call her in the middle of her recovery.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;"">Sarah tried to explain to Jack that she was indeed in the hospital and that her condition was serious. But Jack remained skeptical and questioned her further, asking for details about her illness and treatment.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;"">Feeling humiliated and disrespected, Sarah decided to file a complaint with human resources. They investigated the matter and found out that Jack's actions were not only unprofessional but also a violation of the company's policies, and the company's employee's rights.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;"">The incident caused Sarah much distress and anxiety, and she had to take additional time off to recover. Jack, on the other hand, realized the gravity of his actions and the impact they had on his employees. He apologized to Sarah and assured her never to invade her privacy again, he also went through training to understand the importance of respecting employees' privacy and personal life.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;"">As employees, we all have the right to privacy regarding our personal and medical lives. This includes taking time off from work to recover from an illness or injury without worrying about the impact it will have on our job. Unfortunately, not all employers understand this and may attempt to inquire about an employee's hospitalization, which is not only invasive and disrespectful, but it is also highly unethical.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;"">When an employee is hospitalized, it is important to understand that they are going through a challenging time both physically and emotionally. They may be dealing with a severe illness or injury, and the last thing they need is for their employer to pry into their personal life. Asking an employee about their hospitalization not only puts them in an uncomfortable position but also shows a lack of empathy and understanding for the gravity of their situation.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;"">Moreover, in some cases, the employee may not be comfortable sharing the details of their hospitalization. This could be due to assorted reasons, such as the nature of their illness or injury being highly personal or sensitive. For instance, the employee could be dealing with a mental health issue and may not want to disclose that information to their employer.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;"">Furthermore, it is essential to note that under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and other laws, employers are prohibited from making inquiries about an employee's medical condition or asking for medical information unless it is job-related and consistent with business necessity. Asking an employee if they are in the hospital and why they are in the hospital is not only unethical, but it also may be illegal.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;"">So, what should you do if your boss asks you if you're in the hospital and why you are in the hospital? The first thing you should do is to remind your boss that you have a right to privacy when it comes to your personal and medical life. You can also inform them that it is not appropriate for them to ask about your hospitalization and that it is not necessary for them to know the details of your illness or injury.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;"">It is also important to document any instances of your boss asking about your hospitalization. This could be used as evidence in case you need to file a complaint or take legal action. Additionally, you should consider speaking with a human resources representative or an attorney if you feel that your employer is violating your rights.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;""><span>It is essential that employers understand that employees have a right to privacy and respect when it comes to their medical and personal lives. Asking an employee about their hospitalization is not only invasive, but it is also unethical and potentially illegal. Employers should respect their employees' privacy and focus on providing a safe and supportive work environment.</span></p>","https://cdn.humareso.com/hubfs/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-3769151.jpg","","PUBLISHED","false"

The percentage of those changes that are life-altering are few and far between.","2023-01-19 14:14:38","2023-01-19T14:14:38.958Z","<p>The Facts of Life is a classic TV show from the 1980’s. This show lasted nine seasons! The transformation from a boarding school focused show to one exploring young women making their mark in the world, albeit a bit campy and sappy at times, gave the show its longevity. In season 7, the store, Edna’s Edibles, burned down. The ladies returned from summer vacation to find their business and home burned down. From those ashes arose a new concept store called, “Over Our Heads” along with a new character played by George Clooney (not too bad of a trade-off). Huge changes for the characters as well as for the audience to take in. Those many seasons were filled with many plot twists, character additions and subtractions and a couple of movie-length specials. Change was a primary constant for this series, without needing each change to be so dramatic and over-the-top (despite the fire in Season 7).<br><br>Maybe you haven’t had a “fire” change recently, but change is still affecting you. For instance, have you gone to the grocery store lately? Have you seen the prices? Budgets are blown out. That’s a change that seemed to happen quickly. And what did consumers do then in response? In 2022, 72% of consumers were sometimes or often buying less food. That tactic has economists forecasting prices falling in 2023 to counteract the reduction in demand. The market changed, we changed, the market is changing again. The path of this change has been scary for some. Buying less, even temporarily, has increased need and overwhelmed some food pantries in our country. (If you are looking to help with the food need in our country, visit Feeding America to find a local food bank)<br><br>Certainly, there are those extreme changes – an unexpected layoff, a serious illness, a messy divorce – which will alter the course of our futures, but by and large, many changes are more subtle. A promotion at work, for instance, might change our duties and responsibilities, but we are still in the same environment with familiar people. The change doesn’t pull the rug out from under us.<br><br>The fear of change is often influenced by the extremism we expect. The percentage of those changes that are life-altering are few and far between. But we still worry about what will change, how it will affect us, or what it might mean for those we care about. It can consume our thoughts, especially while we try to sleep! The tossing and turning sets us up poorly for that next day where we continue to fret over the change that might come. Here’s a little secret – change is going to come whether you want it to or not.<br><br>There has been much talk about resiliency as a skill over the past two and half years. With the COVID-19 pandemic, political unrest and racial inequities, we have been encouraged to dig deep and rise above. This resiliency, however, ought not to be put back into hiding. Allow your ability to weather the storms mean something greater than just the pandemic. Let that truth affect even the coolest of changes. You can handle more than you might think, but you also have resources at your disposal (more than ever) to help you manage any mental or emotional personal navigation needed. Wishing change would just stop or choosing to ignore it because you’re tired is not resiliency; it’s foolishness.<br><br>Mrs. Garrett, the pillar of The Facts of Life for almost 8 seasons, left a very successful run with Diff’rent Strokes in order to work at Eastland Boarding School. She left the comfort of the Drummond residence to step out into a change to expand her skills, to challenge her differently and to invest in another group of kids. She made the change with purpose. She led it with grace.<br><br>“There is nothing permanent except change” – Heraclitus. Absolutely, so approach your response with expectation.</p>

Here's a guide on how to quit your job during a recession.","2023-01-04 17:48:44","2025-04-03T19:56:17.155Z","<p style=""font-size: 22px; line-height: 2;""><img src=""https://cdn.humareso.com/hubfs/Humareso%20Blog%20Posts-45.jpeg"" width=""2400"" height=""1280"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Humareso Blog Posts-45"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 2400px;"">It’s a weird time. Yes, I know, there’s always something weird about society, but I am not sure we’ve seen such business realities colliding as we do today. We are on the precipice of an economic recession (if not already entered into it). The degree of severity for this recession is not yet known, but we’ve already seen major organizations, like Amazon and Meta, laying off <a href=""https://mondo.com/insights/mass-layoffs-in-2022-whats-next-for-employees/"">tens of thousands</a> of workers. In previous years where mass separation numbers like these occurred, employees hunkered down and hoped to keep their current positions. That is not the posture of today.</p>
<!--more-->
<p style=""font-size: 22px; line-height: 2;"">According to The Bureau of Labor and Statistics, most of 2022 saw Quit Rates tripling the Layoff Rate. For instance, in <a href=""https://www.bls.gov/news.release/jolts.nr0.htm"">October of 2022</a>, 1.4 million people were laid off, but 4 million people quit their job. We knew in October that a downturn was upon us. The news media was touting the layoffs at Twitter and DoorDash as signs of a tough economy coming home to roost in the US. So, why the brazen disregard for the signs by American workers?</p>
<p style=""font-size: 22px; line-height: 2;"">Remember when Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill) in <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0993846/"">Wolf Of Wall Street</a> quite his job after meeting Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) in a diner and finding out Jordan made $74,000 in a month? Donnie just calls his furniture-selling boss and quits right then and there. He had no idea how the money was going to be made, but he took the risk. But not all employees today are primarily making a jump from their employer because of money.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 22px; line-height: 2;"">A focus on well-being hit all-time highs last year. After the agony of the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw more people in need of emotional and mental support. The uncertainty of the future, the change in social dynamics, the lack of personal presence and interaction all combined to make things difficult, if not unbearable, for many. That strain forced many people to evaluate why they work where they work and how that work gets done. “Is this what I want to be about?” was a readily asked question, not only internally, but often made its way to stand-up and weekly work meetings. The fear of response by leadership to such a question was no longer a major consideration. And when leaders couldn’t answer that question well, employees left. They still are.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 22px; line-height: 2;"">Stay interviews may very well be a good first step within your organization. Asking employees who are working why they have chosen to stay at the company will illuminate mood, successes, failings, culture vibe and professional development. There’s gold in them there hills! Ask good questions. Don’t fear the answers. If there’s a want expressed by an employee, it’s better for it to be shared and addressed. If it cannot happen, after consideration, share that. To know means that I’m not guessing. I’m not wasting time mulling over what the company might or might not do. I have clarity and can make an educated choice as a result.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 22px; line-height: 2;"">We have employees who are bolder about living in authentic ways. That may very well be a new experience for you. If you walk into these situations with an authoritarian approach rather than seeking to understand, you may be met with a wish for you to take this job and shove it. People are less likely to put up with inconsistency and the status quo. They are braver and will take their chances in the job market. Or in the gig economy. Or become an entrepreneur. The options are easier to access.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 22px; line-height: 2;"">Paying attention to the economy, job markets, competition and other indicators is our responsibility.

<!--more--><p>I’ve been a big fan of the Carnival of HR for years. For those of you who are unfamiliar, each month people submit blog posts to share their thoughts and content for all to enjoy. Sometimes there are themes and other months are purely a curation of great HR blogs/articles.</p>
<p>As the host this month, I wanted to have a theme. When you look around the world, it can seem challenging, bleak, and unyielding. It feels like a cover of darkness is always trying to envelop all areas of life and work. I, however, have been someone who believes that people can shed light to make the darkness disperse. So, I asked people to chime in and contribute their perspectives on how they chose to do this. Enjoy the following submissions and make sure to reach out and connect with each of the authors.</p>

"Humareso Blog","Coming Up - Joy at Work, Home and Within Self","Coming Up - Joy at Work, Home and Within Self","en","https://blog.humareso.com/coming-up","John Baldino","Business,Mental Health","The challenge of joy is that we want to feel it every day.","2022-12-09 15:26:00","2022-12-09T15:26:00.535Z","<p style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.75;"">Afresh. That’s the word for 2023. Yup, I’ve decided. Feel free to use the word in sentences throughout the year. “Hmm, I am tired of these clothes. Maybe if I pair things afresh, I won’t hate everything I own in my closet.” “The marriage is stale. The relationship needs some life afresh.” “While I appreciate the dinner you’ve made, looking at your recipes afresh would be a welcome change.” (Let me know how that one goes)</p>
<!--more-->
<p style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.75;"">There are many ways to use the word. It’s applicable at home or work, with friends or family, and for pleasure or for business. It’s the starting point for change. A review of what’s happening and how to revitalize it, whether by approach or adoption. It’s the challenge to look at what’s coming up and infuse enthusiasm into it. Afresh is intentional.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.75;"">When we look at work process, for instance, how can we see it afresh? The complacency that settles in due to the routine of work, whether onsite, at home or remotely, affects what we think of work. We can become stagnant and hate the fact that we’ve become stagnant.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.75;"">The joy of work is different than being happy at work. Ouch. That one might sting a bit. We don’t mind being proactive at work if we’re happy, but if we’re unhappy or marginally connected at best, then we don’t have the energy or desire. We want to be inspired first. Someone needs to come along, usually a manager or business leader, and help me get happy (again, if ever). Once that happens, then I am most willing to approach work afresh.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.75;"">Truth be told, that’s not likely to happen. Your happiness is not a commodity that managers trade well. Many managers are working out their own happiness, and the ebb and flow of emotion is not a competency taught or practiced in most (if not, any) courses of study. Why would we place such a burden into the hands of management? Further, why would I want a manager to have a say in my happiness?</p>
<p style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.75;"">This is where seeing joy afresh is helpful. Joy is mine. I get to focus on this state of being, distinctly different than happiness, and determine where my stability comes from. When I approach work process afresh, I don’t want to manufacture a feeling, but rather, I want to operate out of what’s coming up in me. My joy is mine. I am anchored in truths that encourage joy in my heart and mind. Now, when innovation and creativity are asked of me, I am eager to do so because it means something to me as a result of who I know I am. I have great joy in that. Happiness comes and goes, but joy doesn’t have to.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.75;"">The challenge of joy is that we want to feel it every day. Listen, I love my three kids. There’s nothing I wouldn’t do for them. They are remarkable adults and make me proud at every turn. BUT, they don’t live with me anymore. They are off in college, grad school and beyond, making their own way, living in their joy, even when they don’t feel happy (it’s finals time!). I don’t live daily in state of their presence, but it does not diminish my joy. I may miss them. I may not be happy at moments because of that; however, my joy in who they are and how I’ve been allowed to be a part of that truth is mine, regardless of the circumstances. That’s how joy should operate in your life. Take the time to look at joy afresh.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.75;"">Our organizations need us to push for fresh looks. The messaging of 2022 included a push to bring your whole self to work. Some of you might not be excited about that, not because work shouldn’t ask for that (that’s an entirely different blog post!), but because you haven’t been thrilled with who you are. That’s okay. Today is the day to approach yourself afresh. It’s not about resolutions, but it’s about commitment, habits to encourage those commitments and surrounding yourself with people who will love you through those commitments.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.75;"">The next year is yours. Every year is yours, though. Don’t allow another day to go by without reflection and a path towards patterned change in your life. Yes, work needs you to be your healthiest. Your relationships need that, too. You need you to be your stabilized best. It’s time for life afresh.</p>

For many, love is tethered to condition.","2022-11-17 15:00:40","2022-11-17T15:00:40.652Z","<p><span style=""font-size: 12px;"">In </span><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Lord-Rings-Return-King-Extended/dp/B005529OFA""><strong><span style=""font-size: 12px;"">The Return of the King</span></strong></a><span style=""font-size: 12px;"">, there is a scene at the top of the Orthanc where Saruman affirms the loyalty of Grima Wormtongue to Gandalf far below. Saruman is dismissive of Grima, who is standing there and could speak for himself, and implies that there is nothing that could change the mind of the lowly servant. King Theoden offers to Grima what Saruman cannot – love through forgiveness and in recalling what it means to be part of a community. Theoden reminds Grima that he was once a man of Rohan and can be one again. What Saruman fails to see is that wanting to be treated with love and forgiveness can drive someone who has been without it to extremes. In this case, and aptly done, it leads to Saruman being stabbed by Grima Wormtongue.</span></p>
<!--more--><p><span style=""font-size: 12px;"">Active, authentic love is tough to come by. For many, love is tethered to condition. Literature and history are replete with these accounts. When we work with people who’ve been conditioned in this manner, which is most, someone must break the chain. The systemic nature of conditional love in relationship is generational. Those deposits run deep which is why our action against that breeding needs to be intentional and consistent.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12px;"">In our workplaces, we see this in the most simplistic of situations. </span><a href=""https://blog.humareso.com/4-minutes""><span style=""font-size: 12px;"">Teams</span></a><span style=""font-size: 12px;""> trying to work together can quickly dissolve into factions around whose ideas are better and who has the political clout to get things done. Conditions are placed upon acceptance and engagement. Relationships can be more about popularity rather than people. And as we all know, popularity wanes. It’s something that has to be kept up with regularly and is built on conditions. The negative impact to innovation, high performance and retention is real and affects the cultural construct for an organization.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12px;"">Our job includes smashing these paradigms. Opening the door for true inclusion is not found in pandering. If every voice has value, then how does your organization show that? Of course, not everyone’s ideas can be put into place, nor should they. However, if the win is found in those who have mastered the conditional relationship merry-go-round, then we’ve encouraged shallow, tempered people development. And is something that will not work.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12px;"">You are the one to intervene and work to establish honest, fruitful treatment of persons regardless of “winning” contributions. You are the “plus one” to each person’s daily event of work. Be a great date, so to speak. Be attentive, fun and intentional. Go and lift others up. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12px;"">Yes, it’s tiring. And often, you may be left out in the cold while trying to change the mechanic of conditional love and engagement. Stay the course. Value will be found in the long-term when we can look back on activated change in how people affirm and treat one another. It feels idealistic only because we’ve made it so. We have allowed too much time to elapse without correcting this broken system. That does not make what it ought to be a fairy tale, but rather, a lost art. It’s time to practice it once again.</span></p>

<!--more-->
<ul>
<li><span> </span><span>According to <a href=""https://www.mhanational.org/conditions/seasonal-affective-disorder-sad""><span style=""color: #1155cc;"">Mental Health America</span></a>, about 10 million people in the United States suffer from SAD. The last global study conducted by the <a href=""https://www.healthline.com/health/depression/facts-statistics-infographic""><span style=""color: #1155cc;"">World Health Org</span></a> in 2019 estimated over 250 million people worldwide suffer from SAD. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span> </span><span>Close to 85% of SAD sufferers experience the height of their symptoms during the fall/winter months. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span> </span><span>8 of 10 people who suffer from SAD identify as women. 19% of people who suffer from SAD are of the African, Asian, Latine, Middle Eastern, and Indigenous diasporas. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Scientists do not specifically know what causes SAD. Research seems to indicate that it is connected to some combination of an underproduction of serotonin, an overproduction of melatonin, and a lack of exposure to natural Vitamin D, which occur naturally during the fall/winter months. However, as with most mental health conditions, there has been no conclusive cause determined since SAD was first deemed a unique medical diagnosis in 1984 and research continues. </span></p>
<p><span> Some symptoms of SAD are: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span> </span><span>Feeling sad and/or having a depressed mood not connected to any specific life event</span></li>
<li><span> </span><span>Loss of interest or pleasure in activities typically enjoyed during other times of the year</span></li>
<li><span> </span><span>Tearfulness or unexplainable crying episodes</span></li>
<li><span> </span><span>Increased appetite, particularly craving carbohydrates</span></li>
<li><span> </span><span>Change in sleep habits; usually sleeping too much</span></li>
<li><span> </span><span>Loss of energy, general irritability, and/or increased fatigue despite increased sleep hours</span></li>
<li><span> </span><span>Difficulty sitting still, thinking, concentrating, or making decisions</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Seasonal Affective Disorder must be diagnosed by a medical professional. A diagnosis of SAD will typically depend on whether the person has had symptoms during the same seasons for two or more years in a row and whether their periods of depression are followed by periods without depression. </span></p>
<p><span>Here are a few ways you can support those with SAD during their peak symptom months:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span> </span><strong><em><span>Talk about mental health year-round.</span></em></strong><span> It is important for you and your organization to make it safe for employees to share their mental health status and ask for the support they need to function. Make this a topic discussed regularly as part of health and wellness programming, not just when a tragedy occurs or only during certain times of year. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span> </span><strong><em><span>Embrace flexible scheduling.</span></em></strong><span> Consider adjusting office hours to start later or end earlier or extending lunches to allow employees more opportunity to access natural daylight. Also be open to allowing employees to adjust their schedule as needed to manage their mental health. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span> </span><strong><em><span>Adjust workloads to allow for more downtime and rest. </span></em></strong><span>In our efforts to end the year strong or to start the new year with a bang, we often push productivity at the time of year when people are dealing with high levels of life stress. Consider adjusting to a more moderate pace where possible to allow the downtime, rest, and bandwidth people need to better manage their mental health. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span> </span><strong><em><span>Do not make assumptions.</span></em></strong><span> It is offensive and potentially unlawful to make assumptions about someone’s mental health diagnosis and/or their accommodation needs. If someone in your workplace is showing symptoms of SAD or another mental health struggle, show concern without applying labels. Encourage them to seek help. Let them know that you support them and that their employment is not at risk. Do not make changes to their workload or work schedule unless the employee has requested accommodation </span><u><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">or </span></u><span>there is a specific and documented performance outcome related reason. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>While the holiday season that begins at Halloween and carries through the New Year is typically one associated with fun, joy, and happiness, it is simultaneously a really difficult time for millions worldwide. It is likely that someone in your workplace is grappling with SAD and doing their best just to make it through each workday. Use this information and these tips to help those suffering from SAD or other mental health conditions – and to improve the health, wellness, satisfaction, productivity, and retention of your workplace altogether. </span></p>","https://cdn.humareso.com/hubfs/Picture1.png","","PUBLISHED","false"

When things aren’t troublesome and no one is complaining, we likely fall into the Ilsa-themed tune of “Let It Go.” ","2022-10-26 20:49:12","2022-10-26T20:49:12.545Z","<p><span>The last team to make the 2022 MLB playoff roster was the Philadelphia Phillies. They were struggling for the first third of the season under coach Joe Girardi. Despite having the talent to crush the competition, things were not working well. A change in the manager spot</span><span> (Thank you, </span><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Thomson""><span>Rob Thomson</span></a><span>) and a revitalization based upon skill alignment and contribution pushed this team into a win streak. They were working as a team – a healthy, functioning team. And now, they are in the World Series. </span><span>This is an impossibility</span><span>; yet, the team was able to rise beyond the doubt and the negativity.</span></p>
<!--more--><p><span>Wouldn’t it be great if your team could function as well? Maybe they do. Let’s start there, then.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>One of the more common truths about great teams is that attention isn’t paid enough to the why. When things aren’t troublesome and no one is complaining, we likely fall into the Ilsa-themed tune of “Let It Go.” </span><span>The adage of </span><span>If it </span><span>ain’t</span><span>broke, don’t fix it</span><span> </span><span>does not mean don’t pay attention to it. Be a thoughtful observer as to why things are working well. Measure what you can measure – sentiment, collaboration, productivity, innovation – and track it over time. </span></p>
<p><span>Stagnancy is the biggest threat to healthy teams. That </span><span>same old, same old</span><span> feeling can sweep in like a Nor’easter and cool everything down quickly. </span><span>When the true north guidance that metrics can bring is unattended, opinions come </span><span>o</span><span>n strong and personal preferences rule. Know why what works</span><span> is</span><span> work</span><span>ing</span><span>. Measure it, share </span><span>it</span><span> and encourage it regularly. The magic isn’t in the calculation, but in the affirmation. Bring people along using enthusiasm and vibrancy around the truth of what is working well.</span></p>
<p><span>But, if you find yourself on the other side of a healthy team (we call that an unhealthy team, FYI), then measuring what’s not working is only going to deepen the frustration. Instead, work on the easiest fix first. What is a quick win that can be enacted to shake up the team’s perspective? </span><span>Without pouring tons of effort into the biggest issue</span><span>, you can begin to show investment by that first quick win. And what often happens is that the second win is easier </span><span>to accomplish. There’s more of a willingness</span><span>, even if it’s only</span><span>by a couple of people on the team</span><span>,</span><span> to assist. They’ve seen your willingness to invest and are </span><span>more likely</span><span> to participate in change in the next area. </span></p>
<p><span>Once a few wins are under the belt, the bigger boulders become more apparent. Naming them is easier because more of the team will hear it from a better </span><span>perspective. Defensiveness subsides (it’s not gone so don’t yet expect it) and that allows for </span><span>healthier dialogue and willingness to </span><span>own </span><span>the problem and participate in the correction. </span></p>
<p><span>This happens for work teams just as much as it happens for baseball teams. </span><span>The one secret ingredient is that you need one or two champions on the inside. Take the time to figure out who can catch a vision for what you</span><span> are</span><span> </span><span>wanting to fix. Then encourage them to be a leader in the process. </span><a href=""https://blog.humareso.com/ill-tumble-4-ya""><span>Leader</span></a><span> does not mean you dump all the work and messaging on that person. Instead, it means that the person will help to promote and champion all that’s going on. </span><span>T</span><span>hat person </span><span>believes</span><span> in what you are doing. It</span><span> may be </span><span>a </span><span>foreign concept for </span><span>you based on</span><span> your experiences</span><span>, but the truth of it exists.

"Humareso Blog","Let’s Get Serious: Relevance over Trendiness","Let’s Get Serious: Relevance over Trendiness","en","https://blog.humareso.com/lets-get-serious-relevance-over-trendiness","John Baldino","Business,human resources,management","Trendiness becomes unappealing and ineffective in a short amount of time. Your team knows it.","2022-09-30 15:53:24","2022-09-30T15:53:24.811Z","<p style=""font-size: 16px;"">Overalls were a trend for a bit in the 1990’s. I had both the Kris Kross shorts version of overalls as well as the seven sizes too big pair of full overalls. Truly, I could have fit another person in there with me (don’t ask if I did…I would have to lie). Naturally, my dance moves while wearing the shorts version of overalls were on fleek. I was complimented for my stylish choices in clothing. Yet, when I look at pictures now of those huge overalls, I struggle to remember if the trend was ever attractive.</p>
<!--more--><p style=""font-size: 16px;"">Trendy is not always helpful. It usually isn’t, to be honest. In work, the latest and greatest terms, issues and supposed chasms can serve as a distraction to an organization. We may run around chasing after those “quiet quitting” or those in the “great reshuffle.” Or we tell ourselves today we must be an inclusive culture but then tomorrow focus on being a best-in-class organization. The ebbing of our attention can show our immaturity and lack of seriousness.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 16px;"">How do we get serious?</p>
<ul style=""font-size: 16px;"">
<li><strong>Slow and Steady test</strong> – Not everything you read should be acted upon. That sentence may have just freed your mind. Even if it’s a promising idea, the bandwidth to tackle every opportunity is limited. Trying to put five good ideas into place at the same time may translate into five bad outcomes. And then trying to resuscitate them later is met with more resistance than you would have faced originally. The uphill climb is steeper, and the blame lies with you.</li>
<li><strong>Grain of Salt test</strong> – Not everything that everyone writes or shares is correct. Boom, facts. Some people like to be trendy because it gets them likes and clicks. Their goals are different from yours. Take declarative and command statements with that grain of salt. Research more than one perspective and know the pros and cons. “Experts” may not have worked in the field for decades (or ever!) so be careful. We have the opportunity, sometimes only once, to sit with our leadership team and share these ideas; if we don’t come prepared, then we can lose credibility quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Truth or Dare test</strong> – Relevance is a slippery slope. It’s not only the sharer of perspectives that is trying to be relevant, but the hearer and doer, too. Sometimes we can feel as though if we don’t do something, we might be seen as yesterday’s news. The action doesn’t make you relevant, but impact does. That’s why tried and true methods can still work and be adopted. The relevance isn’t in the trendiness but in the positive business impact, and that is ALWAYS relevant.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""font-size: 16px;"">This is why we must be vigilant in our trendiness quotient. New ideas are <a href=""https://blog.humareso.com/i-want-you-to-want-me"">important</a>. We can’t just do things as we have without testing their impact and validity. But a better way to do things is not the same thing as being trendy. Trendiness becomes unappealing and ineffective in a short amount of time. Your team knows it.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 16px;"">Listen, I’m not wearing either of those overalls at this point. And let’s be thankful for that!</p>

This is not news, but it is the Achilles heel of many an organization.","2022-09-08 16:40:51","2022-10-07T15:14:12.586Z","<p style=""font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;"">The Philadelphia Zoo is the oldest zoo in the United States, originally opening as the Philadelphia Zoological Gardens in 1874. And as early as I can remember, I loved the zoo. The smell, not so much, but the overall zoo is amazing. I recall getting my first Zoo Key (big stuff in 1975) which allowed me to turn on the secret recordings of information about certain animals throughout the property. And while these callbox speakers sounded exactly like a teacher from Charlie Brown’s world, I would listen to them over and over again as I canvased every exhibit.</p>
<!--more-->
<p style=""font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;"">Today, there are a couple of great behind-the-scenes shows on <a href=""https://www.discoveryplus.com/"">Discovery+</a> about the Bronx Zoo and the San Diego Zoo. The Director of the Bronx Zoo shares, at the beginning of each episode, that if you ask a kid to draw a picture of a zoo, you’ll likely see animals behind bars. His purpose, as he continues, is to change that perception by building conservations and habitats that will better suit and support the animals there.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;"">Isn’t that, in some ways, how we ought to approach the habitats we build in our organizations? Of course, the suggestion that employees are in captivity is not the same (though I know some of you feel that way!), but rather think of it as crafting pathways for health amongst our teams by being intentional regarding the environment.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;"">Over the last decade, more organizations have put forth sustainability plans as to how they will handle their impact on the world’s environment. And while this is excellent news, with much more work to be done, many of those same organizations have not put enough thought, let alone action plans, into doing the same for the internal environment for which they are responsible. Both need attention, for sure.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;"">When I watch the various zookeepers, designers and operations experts work together to build a habitat that will support learning, encourage health and offer safety to the animals to be housed, I am often impressed at the careful planning and hours of teamwork offered to get it done. There is a real passion to build something impactful for the benefit of the recipient. And when the animals are released into the designed area, we have the joy of watching them thrive.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;"">Whether our role is business owner, manager or human resources, we have the same privilege. Think about how often meetings you attend are in response to what’s not working or who’s not working. We spend the time putting punitive measures into place, often with a longing for a more proactive approach in the future. We genuinely hope for that to happen, but the rut we get in is hard to dig out from, sometimes years-deep in its making. You are the one who gets to turn the attention on what will help our staff flourish.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;"">Environments matter. And lest you think that those roles working from home must be the best setup, think again. <a href=""https://time.com/6088110/remote-work-structured-hybrid-research/"">Time Magazine</a> published an article with years of research, including the pandemic timeline, to show that those in highly collaborative roles struggled the most with working from home. Their home environment, peppered with some at-home interruptions, made it more difficult to perform to the level desired by both the employee and the employer. Of course, this is not to say that working from the office will solve it all. We know our own experiences that show us how ineffective workplace meetings and collaborative sessions have been. It’s not only about where you sit, but how where you sit has been setup, what resources are available to assist the learning needed, who can support healthy engagement and why it matters.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;"">Transparently, organizations struggle regularly with creating healthy habitats for our teams to thrive. The privilege of asking our teams what might help them to do so is one distinct area we have that the Bronx Zoo does not. We can work collaboratively with our teams to build challenging learning pathways and supportive, innovative teamwork opportunities. We can offer options, and we start by saying we are committed to doing so.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;"">Organizations that build healthy environments are more productive. This is not news, but it is the Achilles heel of many an organization. Likely, attention has been diverted to other things that seem more pressing. Be mindful of the environment being built and how you can be a proactive champion for its construction. Work with other key stakeholders to craft an environment that inspires and provokes people to success.</p>

As a recovering “fixer,” I know my tendency was to offer a 3-step strategy to move things along. Pain from a distant parent, no problem.","2022-08-19 20:57:42","2022-08-19T20:57:42.959Z","<p style=""font-size: 16px;"">There are three young adults who have eaten my food, slept in my house and spent my money for years. They are tremendous. Those who know me have probably heard me share that no less than 10,000 times. Frank, Olivia and Cassandra are bright, funny, kind and loving. Truly awesome people. However, they are not without their vices. And corporately, don’t let them be in a room when an episode of <strong>Maury</strong> is on. They will watch to the end to see if the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dn6JbetlqOc"">man in question</a> is the father of the other guest’s child. They jump around just like the guests and studio audience in disbelief of the results. As the dad watching this, I wind up laughing hysterically, not at the show, but at their responses.</p>
<!--more--><p style=""font-size: 16px;"">I am often struck as to what has led people to the lives they are living. We all have a history. We all wish something would have gone differently. We look back on things with rose-colored glasses. We long for one different turn or choice in our past. This may be to varying degrees, but a shared experience for us all, nonetheless.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 16px;"">As human resources professionals, we are often the ones who hear the stories of regret, pain and anger from the teams we support. On one occasion, I remember sitting in my office crying with an employee who was battling alcoholism and drug use. He was longing for a different path. He was struggling with the pain of past choices and heartbreak. The guilt he felt was as constricting as the longing to return to his addiction. He wanted to know what he did to deserve this pain while he was admitting making the poor choices all on his own. The dichotomy broke my heart.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 16px;"">Our role is not to judge, but to listen. As a recovering “fixer,” I know my tendency was to offer a 3-step strategy to move things along. Pain from a distant parent, no problem. Divorce got you down, no worries. I had the answers. Wisdom came a little later and I stopped feeling like I had to fix it all. And that meant, the unsolicited advice dialed way back.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 16px;"">Each person has a path towards discovery. In human resources, we can default to the policy or the program, but the real support is in the listening and providing the outlet. I have lost count as to how many employees have thanked me after they’ve shared with me for a bit. I would say very little, but the action of being present and listening was enough to encourage and to comfort. They could return to work a little lighter and with more of a focus on what work needed to be completed.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 16px;"">There is often a joke about HR being the counseling department. I understand where that comes from, but truly it’s about listening. That’s what makes it feel counselor-esque. So, how are you doing at listening? Are you more interested in the “dirt” or in the person? I know it’s easy to get wrapped up in the story of the drama. But that drama is the pain someone is bearing. Hear it from that vantage point. Your responsiveness will evolve accordingly if you keep that in mind.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 16px;""><em>(For some additional thoughts on how and why to listen, look back at “</em><a href=""https://blog.humareso.com/leave-a-tender-moment-alone""><em>Leave A Tender Moment Alone</em></a><em>”)</em></p>

<p style=""padding-left: 40px; line-height: 1.75;""><i><span>Ten years come and gone so fast<br></span></i><i><span>I might as well have been dreaming<br></span></i><i><span>Sunny days have burned a path<br></span></i><i><span>Across another season<br></span></i><i><span>A fortune rises to the sky</span></i></p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.75;""><span>It’s as if Mr. Simon is inside my mind on this special day. Ten years ago, Humareso began. I remember sitting at breakfast with a business owner the day after I left my VP role with a national lender. He sat across from me and asked, “So what are you going to do now?” For a moment, I heard that question reverberate in my subconscious. My most honest answer was, “I have no idea.” Instead, what spilled out was a business conviction. Companies did not have all the resources necessary to provide functional organizational drive and impactful cultural change. </span></p>
<!--more-->
<p style=""line-height: 1.75;""><span>I looked across at my breakfast date and shared a vision of businesses with innovation as a core component to every job description while maintaining thoughtfulness to each compliance nuance offered through legislation and case law. My experience in two handfuls of industries showed me that there was a best way to engage with people in spite of varied technical skill and geographic considerations. There were universal truths. And the markets were screaming for them to be incorporated into every organization from start-ups to enterprise corporations. </span></p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.75;""><span>The entrepreneurial spirit had been dormant inside of me for too long and this was the right time to step out. And so, when that breakfast companion finished having eggs and listening to me for almost an hour, he said, “Done. Let’s get started with my company.” I had Humareso’s first client.</span></p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.75;""><span>Emboldened by proof that my idea had legs, I set out to talk to other companies within my sphere of influence. And before long, I was working on a full docket (and then some) of clients of various industries who wanted to know what good human resources should look like. There were hints at some of them; one had a wonderful HR Director who was trying to do great HR, but had a CEO who thought he knew better. When he asked me to come in to help, he regretted that decision quickly. Most of my time was spent with him reshaping how he thought things should go and figuring out where his mode of critical thinking was born. He saw the light, and again, it was confirmation that this road for Humareso was the right one. </span></p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.75;""><span>These ten years later, I can look back at the paths worn by travel and faded by the sun. The gains have far outweighed the gaps. The Humareso team has left a mark of richness, integrity and creativity that I could never have achieved without them. I could not express my gratitude any deeper than by sharing my heartfelt and tearful thanks (yes, I am still a crier…). To have been entrusted with the development of so many within our organization so that they, too, can transform others is core to my credo of sacrificial leadership. You have built Humareso with me. </span></p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.75;""><span>Fostering deeper business relationships, speaking at dozens of conferences and events, writing hundreds of </span><a href=""https://blog.humareso.com/oh-the-amazing-companies-we-work-for-or-not""><span>blogs</span></a><span>, partnering with other HR and technology organizations have all been highlights through these years. The love that Twitter gave me early on as an HR pro helped to propel the message of Humareso faster than I had anticipated. By year 3, we were operating as if it were year 5 (based on my projections), and year 10 has us continuing to be a couple of years ahead, even with the updates. <a href=""https://products.humareso.com/human-resources-outsourced"" rel=""noopener"">Our HRO program began winning awards.</a> The work that we are doing is rich and meaningful. We have impacted tens of thousands of employees. That is not a number to take lightly; I am humbled by just the thought of it let alone the notes of gratitude we’ve gotten through these years. </span></p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.75;""><span>I’m not sure I could have imagined today when I first started. My family encouraged me towards it; they encouraged me away from my fears and into the greatness they saw coming. I have been broken and blessed, which is a path for all of us. For it is in that reality that truth comes shining through – the things you can count on, the beliefs that will truly guide. And as I sit here with ten years of Humareso success to celebrate, I know that there is still more to come. The sun will continue to show those paths, and the fortune found in deepening relationships and positively changed organizations will be the legacy I strive towards. Cheers to Humareso and to all of you for making it so.</span></p>

<!--more-->
<p>The Stonewall riots took place on June 28, 1969, when police raided the Stonewall Inn, a gay club located in Greenwich Village in New York City, sparking a riot among bar patrons and neighborhood residents that led to six days of protests and violent clashes with law enforcement. The Stonewall Riots is credited as the catalyst for the gay rights movement in the United States and around the world.</p>
<p>The first Pride March took place one year later to commemorate the Stonewall riots in New York only. Commemorative celebrations soon began in other cities across the US and the world. The rainbow flag was first added as a symbol of Pride in 1978 and has evolved to be a worldwide symbol, with each color having a unique meaning. Pride became a month-long celebration in 1999, named then by President Clinton as ""Gay &amp; Lesbian Pride Month""; then in 2009, President Obama declared June LGBT Pride Month.</p>
<p>During Pride Month, it has become very common to see organizations alter their logos to match the Pride flag, to share about Pride on their public-facing social accounts, and to hold educational events planned by/for their LGBTQQIA+ employees. These are all good efforts to show commitment to diversity and to create a sense of inclusion.</p>
<p>However, when the Pride Month is over and all the logos go back to their usual colors, I often wonder what these same organizations are doing to keep the energy of Pride going for the other 11 months of the year.</p>
<p><a href=""https://humareso.com/diversity-equity-inclusion"" rel=""noopener"">If you or your organization are wondering</a> what you can do to keep the Pride alive, here are some actions you can take:</p>
<p>Educate about gender diversity. Workplaces have a lot of influence in the lives of the people they employ. Some of this should be used to teach people about the spectrum of humanity and the importance of understanding, respecting, and accepting all identities. Consider including education about gender identity, gender expression, pronouns, etc. in your onboarding, orientation, development sessions, and leadership training. You can also include books, <a href=""https://humareso.com/podcasts"" rel=""noopener"">podcasts</a>, videos, etc by creators of diverse gender identities in their sharing and required learning materials.</p>
<p>Examine policies and programs for harmful gender practices. Many of our handbooks still use gender-binary language. Many of our appearance policies still describe clothing and hairstyling based on gender binary ideals. Many of our uniforms and logo’d items are designed based on gender binary principles. Additionally, many of our office buildings do not offer non-binary options for restrooms or locker rooms. This is not inclusive of gender diversity, and it can be harmful &amp; traumatizing to your employees of gender-diverse backgrounds who are forced to conform.</p>
<p>Ensure equity in hiring, development, and promotion. Gender diversity within your organization should be representative of the community where you reside and of the community you want to see in the future. This means hiring people of diverse gender identities and making sure they are paid a fair, appropriate living wage, as well as making sure they have a path for growth within your organization and the leader &amp; mentor support needed to get them to the higher levels. You should also pay attention to the turnover vs retention data of your gender-diverse employees.</p>
<p>As your organization moves forward from Pride Month and into the remainder of the year, make sure you are continuing to look for ways to demonstrate the pride you have in your LGBTQQIA+ employees and your commitment to helping them live their best lives, both within and outside the confines of your workplace.</p>

The circle of trust exists for all of us, whether detailed or happenstance. We know who we can talk to, really talk to. The hard truth is that there may not be as many as we might hope, perhaps even highlighting that there isn’t anyone we really trust at all.</p>

<p style=""font-size: 24px;"">Recently, I have had the opportunity to listen to a group of people collectively and individually as they work through a conflict. The group gathered based upon one item of tension, but what has come through is that this one item isn’t really the issue. The friction is because there is rampant mistrust within the group. Even those who’ve postured to be simpatico with another have been found to share differently when in a one-on-one conversation. Sub-tier agendas have broken the hope for reconciliation. And now, people are left to merely jockey for empty position. Disheartening to say the least.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 24px;"">Yet, for as upsetting as this is, organizational leadership regularly deals with this. It’s regrettably commonplace in some of your companies. The faux friendships are in place as a mechanism to hold onto a position or to be seen as a “team player” for the next advancement. The work you do matters, for sure, but the politics of relationship cannot be ignored. There are companies that promote trust as a value despite the activity that shows otherwise. Have you fallen into that pattern?</p>
<p style=""font-size: 24px;"">This is not about being bleak. It is about recognizing a broken framework. Are you a participant in the brokenness?</p>
<p style=""font-size: 24px;"">In what has become a classic, <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0212338/""><strong>Meet the Parents</strong></a> explores this concept of the circle of trust directly, and of course, with hilarity. Robert DeNiro is at his over-the-top best as protector and government agent father to Ben Stiller’s neurotic, over-compensating future son-in-law. DeNiro uses trust as a weapon for most of the movie and Stiller works to earn a reprieve from the perceived doubt. If it weren’t funny, it would be primarily awkward and frustrating (it might be that for you anyway!).</p>
<p style=""font-size: 24px;"">Is that how it is for you at work? And for those of you who do your work 100% remotely, do you find that it’s been doable to build the rapport necessary to function in the mechanic of your organization? Over the last year, more employees have been added to companies in a remote capacity that had never been in the office previously. The manner with which trust is built will need to be more intentional with those whom we don’t bump into during the day. Have you made a different effort to be inclusive of those teammates who exist elsewhere?</p>
<p style=""font-size: 24px;"">The first step is to ask yourself: What am I doing to participate in any unhealthy trust construct at my organization? This is not about accusation but awareness. You cannot change what you don’t recognize. Look deeply at your involvement in any brokenness.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 24px;"">The second step is to ask: What is my company doing to support functionally broken trust amongst its people? If the status quo has deep roots in positional jockeying and backstabbing, then those weapons need to be addressed. Those who wield them today and attack those around them may find that tomorrow puts them on the defensive. It’s a quick switch to a protective posture. Your role involves calling it out, at whatever level you find yourself. Open the door to discuss, address and invoke change. (Some additional thoughts on building healthy trust can be found at: <a href=""https://blog.humareso.com/i-would-die-4-u"">https://blog.humareso.com/i-would-die-4-u</a>)</p>
<p style=""font-size: 24px;"">It is sad to watch a group of people live in such mistrust of one another. Backbiting is exhausting. Wearing masks to hide true feelings affects mental health. Why would anyone need to live like this? It’s okay for us to disconnect the mechanisms and change the construct. If, ultimately, it didn’t work out for DeNiro’s tough guy, how could we stand a chance? Fuggedaboutit.</p>

","2022-06-21 16:35:09","2022-06-21T16:35:09.859Z","<p>1 in 4. If you were to have a one in four chance of winning the lottery, you would play. Those chances are a no-brainer.</p>
<!--more--><p><em>Those same odds represent the number of employees who feel hopeless today. </em></p>
<p>That is a hard sentence to type. 25% of our employee population struggle with some sense of hopelessness. At the SHRM Annual Conference, these numbers were shared with the roughly 13,000 attendees. Staggering to us all. We were also acutely aware that the numbers are likely worse since many may not want to divulge their thoughts even in an anonymous survey. Walking through your workplace or joining a Teams or Zoom call and thinking about 1 out of at least every 4 there is feeling a level of dread or despondency is heavy, even burdensome. So, what are we to do?</p>
<p>A focus of the time at #SHRM22 was to commit more deeply to the destigmatizing of mental health issues as well as to offer more resources of support. SHRM has long been supportive of this issue directly to our veteran community and through some other partnered workshops with other non-profits, but COVID-19 and the state of the world have both deepened and widened the number being affected. Mental health support can no longer be a nice-to-have benefit; it sits squarely as a must for today’s organizations.</p>
<p>In my own communication with other attendees representing varying geographies and industries, the talk was consistent. We’re struggling to know who may need support and we are not as effective in sharing what those resources are. Our organizations have been upended with constant communications for the pandemic, CDC safety guidelines, the talent shortage, asking for extra help/support to get work done, and on and on. And now, let’s add mental health to the list of email pushes. Most I spoke with agreed that it would likely be lost in the blob of an inbox or just one of a thousand channels on Slack.</p>
<p>As is typically the case at a SHRM National event, content is aplenty, but the call to be focused on mental health was palpable. The strongest advocate to share was Arianna Huffington, Founder of <a href=""https://pledge.thriveglobal.com/"">Thrive</a>. Arianna pulled no punches and started her time with another statistic: Between the ages of 10 and 34, suicide is the second leading cause of death. The thousands in attendance offered an audible gasp. We’re running on empty and now we feel empty. And the emptiness is not as temporary as we had hoped.</p>
<p>Companies can impact all communities by caring for the teams they have. It’s not about enabling as some might offer, but Huffington shared, that it is more about changing the narrative that “burnout is the price of success.” If you don’t give everything you have and become a shell of yourself, then the opportunity for success will slip through your fingers. It’s a lie and it’s killing people. Organizations must rally resources and offer various communication outlets for coping and equipping. We can do better.</p>
<p>And while SHRM22 did not disappoint in bringing people back together and reminding us that we’re truly not alone, it challenged us to be diligent and intentional about mental health support. I have sat in a room with an employee whose spouse had committed suicide. I have been called by the police to inform me that an employee took his own life, and it was my role to tell the company. I have held the hands of broken parents who were burying a child who felt that she had nowhere else to turn but to end it all. I don’t want to have to do any of those ever again.</p>
<p>Let us be inspired to build up, to resource up and to frame up healthier workplaces. We are so often the joy-givers in our companies. Today, rise and offer that joy like there’s no tomorrow.</p>","https://21594889.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21594889/Arianna%20Huffington-1.jpg","","PUBLISHED","false"

Here are a few helpful to decide how to participate in the Holiday.","2022-06-01 18:05:16","2023-06-09T14:04:14.762Z","<p><span><em>Author: Sarah Morgan, Director, Equity and Inclusion</em> <br></span></p>
<!--more-->
<p><span>Juneteenth is the holiday that commemorates the day that the final group of enslaved Black people in America were notified of their freedom after the Civil War. While the Emancipation Proclamation was issued on January 1, 1863 by President Abraham Lincoln, it took over 2 years for the confederacy to finally surrender and an additional 3-6 months for the union to travel across the country to notify all the enslaved Black people in America of their new freed status. </span></p>
<p><span>The final notification occurred on June 19, 1865 in Galveston, Texas. The combination of the month (June) and the day (nineteenth) is where the naming of the holiday came from. Juneteenth has been celebrated annually since then, mostly in the state of Texas and by Black American communities across the US. In recent years, these celebrations have grown and become more popular to include large, citywide events in major metropolitan areas like Atlanta, Chicago, Detroit, and Los Angeles. </span></p>
<p><span>In 2021, Juneteenth became the 13th Federal Holiday in the US. Several states, cities, and municipalities followed suit by declaring the holiday at those levels and vowing to close their offices to honor the day. Many private organizations then adopted the holiday into their calendar as well, beginning in 2022. </span></p>
<p><span>As we approach the holiday for 2022, reports are already starting of companies making a mess and mockery of their first attempts at celebrating Juneteenth. Because it is a holiday with roots in a difficult part of American history and a very specific marginalized group within our society, companies aren’t sure what to do – and the actions taken so far look more like performative allyship than sincere inclusion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.25; text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"">Humareso helps companies of all sizes navigate their internal and <br>external diversity, equity, and inclusion strategies.</p>

<p style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.75; text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>With about 3 weeks to go before Juneteenth, it’s not too late to <a href=""https://humareso.com/diversity-equity-inclusion"" rel=""noopener"">re-evaluate your company’s plans</a> and avoid potential mishaps. Here are some things to consider as you finalize your company’s Juneteenth plans: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span> </span><strong><em><span>It’s ok to do and/or say nothing.</span></em></strong><span> If your organization has declared Juneteenth a holiday and will close your operations to honor it, you don’t have to do anything more. Most organizations don’t make major announcements for holidays beyond the date the offices will be closed and how the closure will impact deadlines relating to payroll. You do not have to treat Juneteenth differently just because of its historical origins. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span> </span><strong><em><span>It’s ok to acknowledge the dissonance.</span></em></strong><span> There is something strange and a little unsettling about “celebrating” the delayed freedom of a people who never should have been enslaved. There is something strange and unsettling about non-Black Americans reaping the benefit of paid time off for the freedom of a people that their ancestors likely participated in, advocated for, and benefitted from keeping enslaved. There is something strange and unsettling about celebrating Black American “freedom” when Black Americans still face so much hardship and struggle from supremacy and systemic oppression … Yet here we are. Acknowledging the discomfort of this celebration does not diminish the occasion; it adds to it. By confronting what is strange and unsettling during our celebrations, we can begin to fully heal the discomfort and move forward toward a better future in both peace and power. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span> </span><strong><em><span>It’s ok to honor but not celebrate. </span></em></strong><span>Juneteenth isn’t like Valentine’s Day or Halloween. It is not a holiday where you throw together some themed decorations and have a party. It is a very specific cultural memorial celebration. Before planning or buying anything for a company sponsored event, make sure that you’ve thoroughly vetted the ideas, the speakers, the purchases, etc to ensure it is not offensive or diminishing to the significance of the day. Make sure your choices honor and memorialize the event more than party and celebrate the day. </span></li>
<li><span> </span><strong><em><span>It’s ok to express the insufficiency. </span></em></strong><span>One day off over 150 years later does not even come close to repairing all that still needs to be fixed surrounding the oppression of Black Americans. One day off does not help all the other marginalized groups in the US or around the world. One day off does not create equality or equity. One day off is insufficient – but it still matters. And we should still take the day. And we should enjoy ourselves as we honor those we lost and those who survived the atrocities of slavery. It is ok to pause and honor that for a moment, knowing that we must get back to the important work of fully eradicating the lingering remnants of slavery and supremacy the very next day. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Juneteenth is a new national holiday unlike any we’ve celebrated before. It’s ok that finding the “right” and deepest way to honor and celebrate as a nation, as a community, and as a company will take some time. However, because of the cultural sensitivity surrounding Juneteenth, the space for trial and error is very narrow. </span></p>
<p><span>As you finalize the plans for your celebrations, be thoughtful, considerate, and intentional about how and what you do. </span></p>
<p><span>Happy Juneteenth!</span><span></span></p>","https://21594889.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21594889/Juneteenth%20cover.jpg","","PUBLISHED","false"

On a huge movie screen stood a cool guy who could dance. Tony Manero (John Travolta) had everything going on. He had the moves, the hair, the ladies…what more could an Italian guy want in 1977? The movie was a smash, the soundtrack is the GOAT and Travolta a star. And as we often do when something works, we try to extend its popularity. Hence 1983’s <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staying_Alive_(1983_film)""><strong>Staying Alive</strong></a>. Where the first film was legendary, the second languished. Forcing Tony Manero to be relevant in a world that had changed significantly in five years was obvious and embarrassing. Tony didn’t keep up so well anymore.</p> 
<!--more--><p>Welcome to the Federal Government. While it cannot be argued that the Fed was once as cool as <strong>Saturday Night Fever</strong>, it can be said that it has not kept up with a changing world, though trying to market itself as having doing so.</p> 
<ul>
 <li><em>EEO-1 Reporting</em> – how can it be that a governmental form required for companies of 100 or more employees on an annual basis can’t be updated to include classifications of people that the government has already acknowledged Title VII protections for? Some in government have come out to say that the reporting mechanisms pushed out to the masses are difficult to update. That is understandable; however, would the same extensions without penalties be extended to private industries who could argue that they face the same stressors? For those of us who’ve trod HR for decades, we know the answer is a resounding no. We are being told that the reporting for 2023 (based on 2022 data) will include expanded gender and race categories. Let’s hope so.</li>
 <li><em>I-9 Form Completion</em> – while the pandemic was/is difficult to manage, there were alterations made that addressed the need for change. One of them being the way in which I-9s could be verified and completed. The remote nature of work due to public health separation mandates forced the government to allow remote verification of identifications. By and large, it worked very well. And now, we’re going back to the old physical touch of IDs with a fresh push towards utilizing notaries across the country to help. Really? A company in Lincoln, Nebraska who has hired it’s first employee in Anchorage, Alaska has to have that person go to a notary to verify a US passport? Seems burdensome to both the company and the new hire. Yes, there’s E-Verify, but that is not a sweeping federal mandate. The physical checking is. All these companies that have hired workers across the country during the pandemic now need to re-verify information for the I-9. SMH.</li>
 <li><em>Compensation Benchmarking and Pay Equity</em> – the SEC has stepped up and potentially affected shareholder pricing through the improvement in 10K reporting. It is a wonderfully relevant requirement to show how corporate values around inclusion and equity are showing up at work. Proving it requires math, evidence and accountability. These are all areas that the modern workforce desires. And yet, much of the rest of the federal government remains silent on how the laws for pay equity are to actually affect businesses. Other parts of the world (Germany, France, Denmark, for instance) have teeth in their laws around compensation. The data tells us that Americans feel similarly. Publicly traded companies have the option of reporting through the 10K, if they don’t choose another vein of evidence, to show equity in pay; however, most people work for private companies. Now what?</li>
</ul> 
<p>Now, lest you read this as only a gripe, it is, also, meant to be read for awareness. The mixed messaging might affect your teams and confuse leadership. It’s people managers who need to keep the direction clear. It’s line-level supervisors who practice consistency for the benefit of organizational culture. It’s the human resources department that ought to drive organizational relevance. Our people matter and need to know that even if the federal government isn’t keeping up with everything, the company is!</p>

Faye Dunaway and Peter Finch deliver masterful performances as players in the television combine. Dunaway’s character, Diana Christensen, is obsessed with exploiting the downfall of Howard Beale (Finch). Beale is having a crisis of epic proportions (“I’m mad as hell, and I’m not going to take this anymore”). Diana won’t rest until she gets the network the ratings it desperately needs, regardless of the pain and stress inflicted on others. It is a movie worth watching, but be prepared for the frenzy it represents (Both Dunaway and Finch nabbed Oscars for their work).</p> 
<!--more--><p>The rush of activity is sometimes centering for some people, like Diana Christensen. Having that flurry consistently whirling around us is a sign that we’re contributing, we’re valuable, we’re needed. As much as we may complain about it, we want it. Even the days of anger due to the craziness are often only outbursts of frustration set aside the next day to jump right back into the fray.</p> 
<p>Managers legislate to the busy. Recognition and reward find their way to the frenetic and overwrought. Encouragement is not usually posted as “Slow and Steady Wins the Race” on a cubicle-laden office floor. Instead, we value frenzy. Activity equals success at some level and it’s a message we need to reevaluate.</p> 
<p>In human resources, we love to put “must be able to multi-task” under job requirements on a job description. And yet, we almost never measure it for most positions. Do you multi-task well? Have you done so in the last few projects you managed or the string of tasks you completed? Who would know and how? We give credit to those who have been frantic in the completion of work and pin that as a badge of honor.</p> 
<p>It’s not likely that you will pay attention to each detail when you move at such a pace. Quickness is a skill but not to be used at the expense of thoroughness. Employers are not going to stand behind a “get it done quickly” command for long if the work is shoddy or rushed. And with the work from home life that many are living, whether full time or in a hybrid capacity, we can hurry to handle kids, laundry, knocks at the door, work and more! It’s a go-go-go kind of world.</p> 
<p>As managers, take a look at your team. Is the value on speed or accuracy? If an associate is slow, what is the plan to improve? The feeling that an individual isn’t working hard because they aren’t moving quickly may not be enough of a reason to move towards separation. Talent acquisition is difficult, especially with the limited pool we have today. Frenzy ought not determine viability; competencies should. Development is necessary for those competencies. Focus on that and, speed, if that’s part of the goal, will more likely occur.</p> 
<p>Diminishing returns is real for rush-centric environments. For many organizations, the addition of more work to individuals in order to motivate them to move quicker is a failing strategy. Whether in construction, software development or medicine, piling up the work won’t make people quicker; it will have the opposite effect. Productivity falls.</p> 
<p>Being driven isn’t bad. Being driven to rush work may certainly be. It’s no wonder that our teammates who deal with this push from managers are mad. Mad as hell as I hear it.</p>

It was part of the opening monologue from Amy Schumer, Wanda Sykes and Regina Hall. Amy quipped that the three of them were hosts “because it’s cheaper than hiring one man.” Ouch. It was met with much laughter from the crowd because, well, there’s truth to it.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The United States still trends generally at 80% compensation for women compared to men. For those for whom math is terrifying, that means for every $1.00 a man earns, a woman is earning about $.80. The data was, and still is, researched and shared through various resources. It would be difficult for an organization to feign ignorance. How can there be disparity of almost 20% that remains unchanged?</p>
<p>Let’s be clear about compensation analysis and pay equity analysis to help answer that question. Compensation analytics is about external market research and survey studies. It is about finding out how the competition is paying for talent. The ranges of pay based upon the work being done, the displayed competencies of the individual as well as the actual level of the job are all influencers to the market analysis. If you merely go by the job title, you are not going to have accurate information. At all. No, truly, it won’t be right.</p>
<p>Pay <a href=""https://humareso.com/diversity-equity-inclusion"" rel=""noopener"">equity</a> is about the way in which compensation is given within the organization. Perhaps there are differences in who starts at a certain point in some of the pay ranges. Maybe someone starts at $46,000 per year while another starts at $48,000 annually. There can be clear difficulties in justifying why two people doing substantially similar work are paid differently. Areas of experience and used competencies are valid reasons for differences, but these are not often defined and harder to defend.</p>
<p>Further, it is not enough to justify pay equity practices by affirming the rate of increase being the same across the department. If someone starts differently than a similarly qualified person in the same role, then a 2% increase annually will keep them apart indefinitely. That may not be equitable. And too often the inequities are seen in protected classes of people. Bias is there.</p>
<p>In new research, 66% of 5,500 companies surveyed by the compensation data firm PayScale said they plan to conduct a “pay equity analysis” in 2022. That’s a 20% boost over last year. That’s good news, or is it? Merely doing the analysis does not necessitate change. I might plan to conduct a health analysis on myself to determine where I am unhealthy, but that is not the same as doing something about it. We can know something is wrong and not doing anything about it. The one-two punch is to do the analysis, both internally (pay equity) and externally (market benchmarking), and put a compensation plan into practice. You may not be able to fix everything at once, but you will have a clear trajectory of what has to be done. You can put parameters around it based on time, resources and updated analysis.</p>
<p>Equity in compensation, for any organization committed to <a href=""https://humareso.com/diversity-equity-inclusion"" rel=""noopener"">diversity and inclusion</a>, is a must. Should we remain content about it? Is it a joke? Let’s affect next year’s Oscars monologue and take this line of comedy off the table.</p>

There’s a trend on TikTok where people confirm this with a snippet of Beyonce’s Crazy in Love playing in the background. We let those thoughts get in our minds and they shape our days, our belief system and our self-talk. It’s brutal.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>There are those who do affirm that they do not care what others have to say about them. The truth of that may be real from a responsiveness perspective, but it may not be as clean in your mind. We can’t see the process of frustration and pain that may happen there as well as the amount of residue that does remain. We can’t see what is happening in each person’s mind, even those who swear they don’t care. However, we can become better than the feedback we hear, or more likely, that we imagine someone is thinking, but who is teaching us how to do that?</p>
<p>In the workplace, for instance, many hours are spent jockeying for position through calculating how others may perceive what you do. You want to present the best of you, but you are also wrapped up in the way that best of you will be received. In that, stress begins. And lest you think (I love when I sound 1900’s British) that this is a deliberate process, it is often a learned behavior early on in life through the observation of adults.</p>
<p>As a child, you see how adults get things done and establish their positions amongst friends and family. The stress of what others think is across life, not merely the workplace. And much of those learned behaviors get practiced early on in school. We are on high alert regarding the opinions of others. We need to wear the right sneakers. We need to have the right shirt. Our hair has to be done just right. And we heap pounds of stress on our shoulders in managing all of this. This “training” carries into our careers, our homes and our relationships naturally. In a video of Prince being inducted to the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame, he said, “Too much freedom can lead to the soul’s decay.” His acceptance speech was profoundly thought-provoking, and his viewpoint was spot on. Because freedom allows us to engage physically, mentally and emotionally across a variety of pathways and circumstances, we can travel roads that cause more damage than good, leading to an unhealthy pattern of behavior. The decay we experience is from the inside out.</p>
<p>Think about all the people who have taken up residence in your brain. Why are we renting rooms for free to these people? <a href=""https://portal.humareso.com/knowledge/dei"" rel=""noopener"">Take control over these arrangements</a>; speak truth to yourself. You cannot control how everyone perceives you. You, also, don’t know that people are spending time perceiving things about you as you might imagine. You are making mental decisions that affect your behavior and your stress level that do not need to be.</p>
<p>Take a moment the next time that unwanted tenant starts blabbering to you about you. Take that commentary apart and examine from where it comes. Does it have a basis? How do you know? You can take control of these emotions and unwanted pathways. There are thieves in the temple of your mind and soul, and you are the one who let them in. Enough.</p>

"Humareso Blog","You’re Headed for Self-Destruction","You’re Headed for Self-Destruction – Humareso","en","https://blog.humareso.com/youre-headed-for-self-destruction","Sarah Morgan","","Written by Sarah Morgan - Director, Equity and inclusion One of my favorite old skool hip-hop songs is “Self Destruction.” ","2022-02-17 05:00:00","2023-03-24T16:16:09.636Z","<p>One of my favorite old skool hip-hop songs is “Self Destruction.” After 30 years, I still know over 90% of the lyrics. It is one of a few old skool jams that causes me to stop whatever I’m doing and lose myself in the message and the nostalgia for a few minutes whenever I hear it.</p>
<p>The song popped into my head recently as I was planning an exercise about the connectedness of the various business functions after in-fighting over who is the most important, who deserves the most accolades, attention and budget resources led to a total breakdown.<!--more--></p>
<p>I found myself looking to these lyrics for explanation and inspiration …</p>
<p><em>It really ain’t the rap audience that’s buggin<br>It’s one or two suckas, ignorant brothers<br>Trying to rob and steal from one another<br>You get caught in the mid<br>So to crush the stereotype here’s what we did<br>We got ourselves together<br>so that we could unite and fight for what’s right</em></p>
<p>The first thing I had to remind them is the majority of department employees are positive about and supportive of what each area is trying to do. We recognize each others’ value and we celebrate it. There are only a few bad apples who are insecure in their knowledge and their roles that are causing the problems. The positive voices must continue to speak often and loudly to mute and drown out the negative sounds.</p>
<p><em>Pop pop pop<br>When it’s hot who’s to blame?<br>Headlines, front page, and rap’s the name</em></p>
<p>Whether it is Marketing or Operations or Accounting, when things go wrong, the company as a whole gets blamed. Customers and clients don’t care about our department beefs and squabbles. They see us as ONE and they expect consistency and excellence. We need to start seeing ourselves the same so that we work to help each other and not undermine each other.</p>
<p><em>If we want to develop and grow to another level<br>We can’t be guinea pigs for the devil<br>The enemy knows, they’re no fools<br>Because everyone knows that hip-hop rules</em></p>
<p>Fighting each other doesn’t help our organization to be successful. We need to focus on our common goals and the ways we are connected, not create further division. We have to keep our internal disputes under control and under the radar so that it doesn’t spill over into the success of our business.</p>
<p><em>It’s time to stand together in a unity<br>Cause if not then we’re soon to be<br>Self-destroyed, unemployed<br>The rap race will be lost without a trace</em></p>
<p>The wars between the departments will have your organization headed for self destruction. By setting out to make the other look less valuable, the whole organization looks foolish and suffers because of it. We must learn to focus on understanding the purpose and goal of each function and look for how we can help each other to be successful and advance.</p>
<p><em>Learn to be<br>Self-sufficient, independent<br>To teach to each is what rap intended<br>But society wants to invade<br>So do not walk this path they laid.<br>It’s Self Destruction</em></p>
<p>The real “enemy” is our outside competition — the companies and industries that our organization competes with for customers, clients, resources, revenue, and market share. Not our own Operations or Accounting or IT – and definitely not any of the functions of HR <img draggable=""false"" role=""img"" class=""emoji"" alt=""😉"" src=""https://21594889.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21594889/Imported_Blog_Media/1f609.svg""></p>","https://21594889.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21594889/Imported_Blog_Media/self-destruction-1.jpg","","PUBLISHED","false"

Being able to share that you are not fulfilled where you are working or that this off-center company is not for you is a release of stress and anxiety. It is not easy to do, but the burden-lifting is energizing for far too many. We’ve stayed in organizations that are not progressing or are not recognizing talent. To be in that kind of environment for a long period of time takes a bit of you. So when you resign, it is huge. In Burn After Reading, Osborne Cox (John Malkovich) resigns from his CIA role with some colorful language. He is bound up with the angst that pouring your spirit and efforts into unappreciated work will bring. After being advised that he is being demoted, Cox quits his job, takes a few jabs at those in the room and storms out, in a very Malkovich sort of way. It’s a memorable exit.</p> 
<!--more--><p>To be sure, not all resignations are quite so dramatic.</p> 
<p>And if that’s true, why don’t we talk about those who’ve departed? Almost immediately, a former colleague becomes He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. That employee was a part of the work – the successes, the failures, the innovations, the recalibrations, all of it. Managers and leaders go so far as to refuse to acknowledge that person’s existence. Why must we pretend that person was not there?</p> 
<p>Ego is at the heart of the matter. There is something disloyal and dishonorable to many managers about someone leaving. Many of those who resign have their reputations tarnished, sometimes within a day of the departure. Performance shortfalls, bad decisions and overinflated mistakes are shared with more people than should ever be done, if at all. Someone who had been an asset becomes the “worst employee we’ve ever had.” Those responses are usually a clear sign of a bruised ego.</p> 
<p>We ought to help managers expect separation at some point and to have walked through the right kinds of responses to it. This is not to say that all resignations are from great staff; there are times it’s a blessing! But, more times than not, the issue is more about dealing with a qualified contributor leaving than it is a poor performer moving on. How have you helped managers prepare for someone leaving? Left to its own devices, the ego will jump in as the knee-jerk response.</p> 
<p>It is healthy to refer to people who’ve contributed in the past. It is not necessary to pretend that they did not exist. Many of those former employees have helped to get the company where it is so their contribution can still be recognized. And it should not be done so begrudgingly.</p> 
<p>People have moved on from your organization for a variety of reasons – better pay, an advanced role, geographic needs, family considerations. Those reasons are not all bad. In the under 50-employee organization I am leading, there are not management roles available for everyone. If someone has their heart set on being a manager, they may move on. I respect that and understand that there is an opportunity available to them elsewhere that I do not have today. I don’t have to take it personally and neither do you.</p> 
<p>Lastly, don’t think your current staff aren’t paying attention as to how you are treating former employees. They know what you are likely to say about them should they leave. You are not coy; you have been a character assassin. Those employees who remain often distance themselves from you as a result of this behavior. You don’t need to put up walls. Take them down through acknowledgement of current and past contribution.</p>

<p>""New Year’s resolutions at work can help create an inclusive work environment. Everyone in the department or team will state what their work resolution is, and this will form a discussion. This is a way for your department or team to discuss your resolutions. The discussion creates an open and safe dialogue in the workplace that will help embrace inclusion and unite the team. This exercise will help prioritize and guide employees with their roles, goals, work culture, and upcoming projects.""</p>

HR responsibilities include payroll, benefits, hiring, firing, and keeping up to date with state and federal tax laws.

<p>“While I know there’s a tremendous focus on recruitment right now, organizations can’t ignore the employee experience. Because that’s what attracts and retains employees.</p> 
<p>And when we think about the employee experience, one of the most common themes I’m seeing is diversity, inclusion, equity, and belonging (DEIB). Employees want to work for organizations that bring together different people because it helps individuals learn and grow. They want to be a part of organizations where everyone is welcomed and valued. Employees want to know that equity exists in their organization.""</p>

The idea of someone or some institution telling me what to do is akin to sandpaper on skin. ","2022-01-20 05:00:00","2022-05-26T21:12:02.118Z","<p>What is it about rules that just rub many of us the wrong way? The idea of someone or some institution telling me what to do is akin to sandpaper on skin. It’s not good. As a young, obedient boy, I spent most days doing what I was supposed to do. I followed the rules. I didn’t like the idea of being outside of the lines. Once high school hit, I pushed those lines in more reasonable ways, but still not way out of the park. And then there was college…I pushed hard against rules and rule-makers. I was sick of it. In The Perks of Being a Wallflower, pushing against the status quo is a core movie plotline. Seniors in high school breaking rules, trying to corrupt younger students and taking risks beyond their ability to rebound make up a large part of the drama. The consequences are realized with plenty of fights, heartbreak and depression throughout. And while our workforce is not a teen drama, we may have some of those rebellious, angst-ridden new hires who want to buck up against those rules, i.e., the handbook. You know, the handbook. That dreaded document that our attorneys and liability insurance carriers require us to have (some of you are also those rebellious employees who won’t do the handbook because those entities are telling you to do it).</p> 
<!--more--><p>It’s necessary. There, I said it. It’s necessary. However, the premise for its existence needs to be shared better with the teams receiving it. It’s a both/and document. How so? It’s both a compliance/employee guideline document as well as a deliberate view of the organization’s hustle and flow.</p> 
<p>For any organization, there are federal, state and local laws that have to be shared with our employees. Our teams need to know what rights they have and what access to resources are available. They need to know where to go when things are great, terrible or awkward. They need to know how to activate the benefits that are part of their employment. They need to know about the employee experience at your organization.</p> 
<p>And while there are components of the handbook where the language is prescribed by law (not leaving much room for creative writing), there are other opportunities for an organization to give insight into their vibe. Are you including a welcome to the company? How about including the mission, vision and values of the organization? Are there messages from leadership throughout? Think creatively as to how you can offer employees a context into what the organization is like.</p> 
<p>Handbooks may not be the most appealing part of HR, but it is a guidebook for the team. Because of that, the team has another resource at its fingertips. Should they really have to call one, two or five people to find out how the PTO policy works? Should they have to wait until business hours if they want to see the policy on taking leave? Let your team have the resources needed to find out the answers to their questions whenever they’d like.</p> 
<p>An employee handbook is a way to offer corporate perspective and a respect of the rights of employees. Even your most rebellious employee will appreciate a level of self-sufficiency and independent access to this guidebook. If staff think it’s just a book of rules, start to change that dialogue. Share the heartbeat of the handbook in orientation,</p> 
<p>touch on points of it in weekly meetings and refer to its resourcefulness through other company outlets and platforms. Keep it updated and relevant to your team. After all, “Things change. And friends leave. Life doesn't stop for anybody.”</p>

What about the perks?” Ah, just love those candidate questions during an interview. Yes, that’s verbatim from an interview I had some years back. I understand the desire for perks. I like to have them myself. But what perks are the perks to percolate? (See what I did there?) It’s bound to be different for different organizations filled with a varied population.</p> 
<!--more--><p>When Fern (Frances McDormand) takes her role as a temporary employee at Amazon, one of the perks is the lot rental for her RV. Now while a lot fee being paid for by your company may not seem like a desired perk, it is for those whose daily lives are connected to their RV. Nomadland was a film inclusive of a few uncommon perks for workers while it showcased the geographic subculture of RV living. For the nomads involved, those perks meant so much.</p> 
<p>When companies in metropolitan areas offer commuter benefits to employees, they are often influenced by law much more so than by having an eye towards the needs of their team. Mandated perks aren’t perks of the company; they are entitlements legislated by local officials. Think about health benefits. If your organization has 50 or more Full Time Equivalents working and it’s offering medical benefits, they are doing so out of compliance to the Affordable Care Act. They must provide the option.</p> 
<p>That’s why in today’s market, candidates are looking for the extras. The extras often tell them about the values of the company without having to read the values of the company. If a company has an option for life insurance, pet insurance, adoption support, student loan repayment or one of many other creative options, that may be an indicator as to what a company cares about or is like. It is not the only way to understand an organization; it is a way.</p> 
<p>Is your organization open to specialized perks? With the difficulty in finding qualified candidates for open roles as well as the roller coaster of the COVID pandemic, businesses have every reason to be creative in perks. Think about what might matter to your staff. In addition to considering those things, ask your team. It’s ok. You can ask them.</p> 
<p>Some business owners and executives get a bit nervous about surveying or asking employees about desired perks. The worry is that if we ask and don’t deliver them, they’ll become disgruntled and disengaged. Yes, that could happen, but the way to best handle that is the upfront context. Let the team know there can’t be a guarantee that the things shared will be implemented. Part of the information will assist in future spend and budget planning, but part of it may influence picking one perk that can be offered sooner. You should be ready to do something, but not everything. There is a difference. It’s not an all or nothing setup as long as you really set it up.</p> 
<p>There is no way anyone can know what everyone would consider a perk. For some, it’s an extra day of PTO. For some, it’s an expanded EAP. For others still, it could be daycare cost assistance. It can vary based on preference, season of life and interest. This is an opportunity to be creative and considerate simultaneously.</p> 
<p>Oh, what happened with the candidate who wanted to know about the perks? He wound up being the candidate we offered a role to which he accepted. He then excelled at his work and entered the management training track where he built a talented team that upped performance by 16% for the department. The perk he liked best? A covered parking spot. He didn’t want rain to hit his car, baby.</p>","https://21594889.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21594889/Imported_Blog_Media/Nomadland-1.jpeg","","PUBLISHED","false"

There were other theories that Dr. Seuss offered, “But, whatever the reason, his heart or his shoes, he stood there on Christmas Eve hating the Whos, staring down from his cave with a sour, Grinchy frown at the warm lighted windows below in their town.” Hating…rough.</p> 
<!--more--><p>We would be remiss to not identify the truth for many this holiday season, which is that it’s not happy, merry nor bright. Whether Hanukkah, Christmas, Kwanzaa or Festivus, it’s not celebratory. There are plenty who cannot see family for a second year in a row due to the pandemic and its related travel restrictions. There are those who do not have others with whom to rejoice; yes, that still happens. With a socially distant existence for many, relationships have suffered. It may not be true for you, but that does not make it so for others.</p> 
<p>On more than one occasion, I have heard one person refer to another as a “Grinch.” We are desperate to label. If you don’t fit into the paradigm I want, then I must find a way to categorize you. Truth be told, most labeling is about the labeler feeling better/authoritative/powerful over another. We label to bring ourselves some faux sense of position to quell the unsettled churning within us. Too broad? Think about it in your own life.</p> 
<p>When we find out the story behind why someone is responding as a Grinch, we may have the opportunity to jump into action as an advocate rather than as a bully. It’s our A-B testing. Once a valid story is heard and mildly verified, we decide to keep name-calling or to assist in making the holidays better for that person.</p> 
<p>Many moons ago, there was a manager who was a curmudgeon during the holidays. Mind you, this was a retail setting which gave everyone working there a reason to loathe the holidays, but this person was exceptional at being unhappy. People gossiped about him and what size pole must have been inserted during his childhood. When I had an off-handed opportunity to chat with him while we were handling a stockroom issue, he shared that the holidays made him miss his mom greatly and he didn’t like being reminded about Christmas all day every day at work. He was skilled in the core components of his job, but the environment, at least seasonally, drove him inward. When I encouraged him to try to enjoy those still with him today while affirming the beautiful memories he had of his mom, tears filled his eyes. He didn’t want to feel like this. As a hugger, I embraced him, and he melted into a puddle.</p> 
<p>I became an advocate for him and would not allow others to minimize him. Was he a Grinch? Perhaps, but he had a reason. And it was not a reason unlike what some others face. At the time, I was young in my profession and did not know enough about mental health and support, but I knew enough to care for someone hurting. Today, there are more resources available to those needing support. And we can offer them without the need to label anyone.</p>

I had not heard sounds like that before. I had not heard sounds put together like that before. I found these four people speaking a language to me that I was unaware I knew how to speak. They defined a creative genre for me that I still listen to today.&nbsp;</p> 
<!--more--><p>Creativity is a business imperative, and it’s not going to change anytime soon. Percolating ideas has often been encouraged in our business environment. We’ve been encouraged for years to ideate and to foster innovative work time for our staff. How often have you brought those people together to consider their ideas as a combination or layered approach?&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Do you remember the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuCMJWSK6Bk"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">old Reese’s Peanut Cup commercials</a>? “You got your chocolate in my peanut butter!” “You got your peanut butter on my chocolate!” And we are led to think that this fortuitous accident led to the best chocolate candy ever made (not my view, but what I have been told). Look within your company – Where is there a Reese’s product waiting to be born?&nbsp;</p> 
<p>When Amazon initiated ideation time within their organization, separate ideas around improved delivery experience, logistics streamlining, and inventory controls were happening. Creative approaches to each of those areas led to cost considerations as well as concierge service value proposition (What would it be worth to a consumer to have delivery control?). Once those creative approaches were brought into the same room, Prime was born.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Various departments at Amazon were brought together. The red tape was cut. Bravado and positioning were laid aside. The freedom to be creative and collaborative was real, not just a value listed on the wall. If your organization is to venture more deliberately into shared creativity, the rub is usually the politics, not the innovation. Is your environment one of “keeping your toys” or distrust? If so, don’t launch this idea until you address that.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>From a viewpoint standpoint, the business culture we’re in right now is the most opportunistic. Many organizations have more people working for them who live in other parts of the world due to the opportunity for remote work. These last two years, while difficult in a variety of ways, have allowed for new perspectives and experiences to be offered. Life in Pakistan is different than life in Poughkeepsie, but for the first time, you may have employees working together from both locations. That is gold for ideation.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Lead through those new environments. Bring resources and people together with ideas they’ve already been encouraged to work on. Allow those Zoom Happy Hours be more productive! Use breakout rooms to foster a dynamic problem-solving session. Whiteboards can be real or virtual; use both! Enable resources to bring the creativity necessary for business growth, relevance and opportunity. That is part of a leader’s role.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It can’t be just an idea; it must be activated. Your organization needs this to happen. So, get some peanut butter and chocolate and get going.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

No matter the background, people like the opportunity to share what they know with someone else. We get immense value from being a resource, some help, an information leader to those around us. We do. And yes, we don’t always feel like being this or doing it, but in the grand scheme of it all, we like it.</p> 
<!--more--><p>A few years ago, Steve Farber wrote an <a href=""https://www.inc.com/steve-farber/5-things-to-give-away-that-will-immediately-improve-your-life.html"">article for Inc</a> where he shared ideas about improving your life by giving things away. Sounds reasonable. I mean, do I really need to take that unopened electric skillet with me on another move? But Steve did not only focus on stuff, but the intangibles as well.</p> 
<p>It's perfectly natural to worry about your turf, your ideas, and your position in the world. Of course, you don't want to give away all your successful techniques and habits. But if you do, you will find that you have gained, not lost, in the exchange.</p> 
<p>Notice that he zeroed in on “want.” You may not want to give away those secret sauce tricks, but by doing so, you’ve increased the opportunity for others to succeed. You’ve, also, increased the innovation curve. Building upon the strides you’ve made is a business imperative. Think about the history of your techniques. Were they 100% original? Not likely. They were built upon someone else’s efforts, expanded upon and developed further. That’s a good thing. Now, let someone else do the same with what you’ve done.</p> 
<p>If we’re serious about developing others, then we must accept giving things away. And at the heart of it all is an understanding that I don’t need to own it all. It’s all been a gift to me and it’s my joy to hand it off to the next crop of curious minds. Can you get behind that philosophy?</p> 
<p>Some of you have been burned. Yes, it’s true. Either you’ve tried to give away what you know, and it’s been rejected by the audience you had. I’m sorry for that, truly. It’s a shot to the esteem to have what ought to be willing recipients turn out to be critical doubters. The call to action, however, ought not to be forgotten; it’s just that you had the wrong people to develop. They didn’t want it, fine…now find those that do. They’re there. Look for them.</p> 
<p>On the other hand, some of those burned may have suffered by systematic changes. What you’ve done is obsolete. Technology or process improvement may be occurring at the same time you’re ready to give away what you know. And now what you know isn’t so great. May I say that’s not true. The advancements have come off the back of the truths you’ve been living and performing. Let not the history of evolution in work be lost. Your connection to the story is incredibly important to the development of others. They need to know that where you start may not be where you end up – as a process, as a procedure or as a person.</p> 
<p><a href=""https://movies.disney.com/mcfarland-usa""><strong>McFarland, USA</strong></a>, tells the story of a coach who didn’t want to invest in the role that he had with the students he had in the location he was working. He was unhappy. But when he caught a glimpse of the talent to be developed, his willingness changed. He got involved, very involved. His passion then motivated the students who took what he taught them and exceeded his expectations. That’s the beauty of developing others. It’s often better than you could envision. You just have to be willing to do it.</p>

Whether just meeting someone or working to deepen an existing relationship, areas of commonality help. I can remember sharing a locker in 7<sup>th</sup> grade with one of the tougher guys in the school. Now, shocking as this may be, I was not considered as tough. I didn’t tip the scales that way at all. So, when we were going to share a locker, I thought, “well, here we go. Getting stuffed into a locker might not be as bad as I think.” A couple of weeks later, when I pulled out a bottle of vodka from the top portion of the locker as I searched for a textbook needed, I knew that this assigned relationship might be a strain. As I worked up the courage to speak to my locker buddy about my find, and my concern about getting caught, he was gracious and kind. He shared that he understood and probably shouldn’t have brought that into school. He was kind, but more so, we found common ground.</p> 
<!--more--><p>You see, he couldn’t afford to get into trouble. He had been in enough of it. He would have to explain at home, again, why he was in detention or suspended. I didn’t want him to be in trouble anymore. And I told him that. I meant it.</p> 
<p>We had a moment. A common ground moment. We didn’t want to get into trouble. Whether it was anymore or any at all, we could agree that avoiding trouble was the goal.</p> 
<p>There are real pathways that illuminate once you look backwards. Wait, what? When common ground is found, it is easier (not easy…there’s a difference) to work backwards in order to respond to that common desire or outcome. Get back to that goal (prepare to remind everyone a few times along this journey of what that goal is). If, however, the goal differs, then there is not a place from which to start. There is a division straight through it all. And many of you have spent hours, weeks, years trying to align a path towards success when there is no common ground to act upon. How can there be a way forward?</p> 
<p>Often, when I see the effect of a lack of common ground, I call it out. Just share what is observed because if you are wrong, those involved will tell you. They will have to tell you what they perceive the common ground is. And the others involved will have to do the same in response, in either agreement or clear disagreement. And I like being wrong in these situations. I want those involved to fight for common ground. They are more willing to relent some innocuous minutia that they’ve been hanging onto which has served as a distraction.</p> 
<p>If it’s been a while since you’ve used the common ground technique, dust it off. If you’ve never used it, it’s a relatively simple one to try. And if there’s some anger on behalf of a participant or two, be gracious. They may have been ready for an argument, not a peace accord. Your solution moves everyone towards a center with the illumination of options appearing as a result. It can be very difficult for those who have had to fight to get where they are or for an organizational communication history fraught with staunch rhetoric and positioning to evolve.</p> 
<p>People evolve and so do organizations. My locker buddy and I are still connected to this day. Vodka didn’t divide us. It helped bring us together. Huh, never thought I’d write that.</p>

Learn why businesses should support and encourage personal growth.","2021-10-18 04:00:00","2023-08-31T21:11:16.422Z","<p><img src=""https://cdn.humareso.com/hubfs/Humareso%20Blog%20Posts-9-Easy%20on%20Me.jpeg"" width=""2400"" height=""1280"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Humareso Blog Posts-9-Easy on Me"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 2400px;"">When my 20-year-old daughter said she would want to rent a place in Greece, I told her that sounded great. Wait, what? Send one of the two beautiful, brilliant, kind daughters I have across the world? Absolutely.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Opportunity is all around us. Over the last fifteen years, experiential options have improved greatly. Whether it is studying in Iceland while participating in once-in-a-lifetime outdoor adventures, creating an ecommerce business while backpacking through Europe or taking a few years after college to live in a yurt and design websites, the flexibility of work, of commerce, truly, of life is unlike any time in history.</p>
<p>When I read Time Magazine’s recent article, “<a href=""https://time.com/6107587/linkedin-ceo-ryan-rolansky-interview/""><strong>Gen Z and Millennials Are Leading a 'Great Reshuffle</strong></a>,’” the focus on both sides of the work experience was explained by Ryan Roslansky, CEO of LinkedIn:</p>
<pre class=""wp-block-verse""><em>Right now, all companies, all CEOs, are rethinking the way their company works. They’re rethinking their culture. They’re rethinking their values and about what it means to work at their company. And on the other hand, you have employees globally who are rethinking, not just how they work, but why they work and what they most want to do with their careers and lives.</em></pre>
<p>So why do so many businesses get upset when employees leave to pursue their next adventure? Perhaps more to the point, why do managers get mad at staff who quit?</p>
<p><strong>Displacement</strong> – the upturning of a department is an annoyance. Even if the organization has done a proactive work in knowledge management and cross-training, the finality of someone leaving does change things for a department. There is comfort and familiarity in communication with the current employee; a new employee will require effort and finesse in getting to know nuances and cues. The team left behind has to navigate this new relationship. It’s not terrible, but it does add work to the remaining employees.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery</strong> – before the new employee ever walks in the door, you have to find him/her/them. And the talent market today won’t go easy on you. There will be great effort and creativity in sourcing required. Time that you will argue you do not have will be spent. Resources that are already strained will be tapped. Knowing that this will happen, prepare. Build a continuous candidate pool, gather pertinent interview questions and market your employer brand regularly.</p>
<p><strong>Dejection</strong> – when you are rejected, it’s natural to feel dejected. Most managers and supervisors have not been taught how to do deal with departure. It may very well be personal. The knee-jerk response may be to tell a supervisor to be mature about it and not take it to heart. Well, if an employee is leaving, based upon an exit interview or some shared information, because of a manager, then why would you not want a manager to contend with how that feels? The dejection can serve to change behaviors. A mature manager will want to say, “I don’t want to feel like this again. I need to do differently.”</p>
<p>If we have cultivated a level of fear about employees moving on, then we short-circuit our abilities to deal with loss, to encourage a wider view of personal growth and to act critically for the sake of both the employee and the team. It’s not easy, but it can be deeply beneficial.</p>
<p>When I was 20-years-old, I would have been discouraged from heading to Greece. I would have been discouraged from heading outside of Philadelphia, truth be told. But seeing what those adventures can develop within a person makes me excited when someone wants to walk forward towards a new opportunity. It’s powerful.</p>
<p>And my Greece-seeking daughter has not booked her flight yet, if ever, but she already has time in China under her belt. She and her siblings will be bringing that worldwide experience to bear on some companies yet to come. I hope they’re ready.</p>

It’s not a secret. Anytime there is something emotional happening on the television that my family and I are watching, they turn ever so slightly to me to see if the tears are forming. And 90% of the time, they are (the other 10% is when I have already wiped them away without their notice). Movies, shows, commercials – I am an equal opportunity crier.</p> 
<!--more--><p>When I first saw the trailer for the Broadway-show-now-movie, <a href=""https://dearevanhansen.com/""><strong>Dear Evan Hansen</strong></a>, I knew I was doomed. You see, I knew what the story was about having read up on it. I avoided seeing it on Broadway for years. I knew I would be a blubbering mess. Wearing a raincoat into the theater would have caused some stares to come my way (actually, it is New York City, so maybe not). As I have gotten older, I realize more what it is that causes me to respond this way (I should mention that I don’t think it is a problem – to my fellow criers, carry on). It’s brokenness.</p> 
<p>The first time I had to sit with an employee who shared that he was going to die from cancer, I wept. I sat in the moment with the person and just listened and shared in the heartbreak. This employee wanted to keep working as long as he could and did not want his team to know that he was facing this, at least not right away. He wanted to lead his own story and not have “HR” take the reins. I didn’t want that responsibility, so I was happy to let him lead. What I could do, however, was take the lead in checking in with him and being broken with him.</p> 
<p>It's in that compassion that our work has depth. Were my policies great for leave management should he need to use it? Of course (spot on, actually). But the humanity needed took precedence and should have. And while that may not seem earth-shattering to you, there are varying types of brokenness that people face. Are we as adept in offering compassionate consideration despite thinking that the issue at hand isn’t that deep?</p> 
<p>Once, someone sat with me and shared that she was struggling to balance work, pursuing a Masters in the evening and having time for herself (to work out, watch a movie, read a book). At that moment in time, I was working 60 hours per week and had 3 children (ages 9, 7, 5); I was trying to figure out how to be a better partner to my wife in raising the family. And now this person was struggling with all of her “self-centeredness” when I hadn’t had a good night’s sleep in years? I could have said, “You know what? Joe shared with me that he’s dying of cancer. Your difficult schedule pales in comparison to what he’s facing.” To what end would that lead? To make her feel badly? To scold her for facing the truths in her current situation? No. She, too, deserved compassion, and that’s what she got.</p> 
<p>For any of us, our frame of reference and season of life influences some of where our brokenness is found. And while the young lady in the previous account was not living the same season as I was, she was expressing stress and strain through tears in that conversation. It was real for her, and she was not sure how to move beyond it. It’s okay for her to feel how she did. In 20 years, she may look back on that time and long for those types of problems instead of what she may be currently facing, just like any of us would and maybe already have. But for that day, she was broken based on what was in front of her.</p> 
<p>Compassion can be offered at each of those stages. To an adolescent about to embark into the waves of middle school, to a first-time, full-time worker nervous about what work will be like, to a new mom or dad worried about what kind of parent he/she/they might be, to someone experiencing loss for the first time – in all these situations, we can offer compassion in our listening and in our responsiveness.</p> 
<p>When I watch <strong>Dear Evan Hansen</strong> on the big screen, I will fall into the story. I will feel what those characters are feeling. I will put myself into that moment. And my heart will break for the story being shared. It doesn’t matter whether you are an “emotional” person or not, you can still feel something and tap into that to develop your compassionate responses to others. And in that journey, some self-discovery will take place. You will be found.</p>

Think about it from the new employee perspective. What might someone see about rapport development at your department or office? Is it easy to jump in? Is it exclusive? Is there a pecking order?</p> 
<!--more--><p>The great Ed Asner passed recently. Ed was an actor on one of the best workplace comedies ever made – The Mary Tyler Moore Show. As Lou Grant, Ed personified that curmudgeon-softie-boss character perfectly. That cast illustrated an office staff of various personalities working together to produce a compelling daily newscast. Add to it extraneous relations dropping in at Mary’s apartment and deepening work friendships, you create a story of paranoid and problem-solving colleagues making their way through life.</p> 
<p>It would be foolish to look to that show as a template for your work environment. It’s not foolish because “The Mary Tyler Moore Show” was, well, a show, but rather, that watching a workplace unfold is very different than being a part of a workplace unfolding. The endearing quirkiness of the show becomes an exasperating annoyance in real life. It’s not cute. The characters aren’t lovable. And the work to build rapport isn’t valued.</p> 
<p>So, how do we better approach workplace rapport development?</p> 
<p>Firstly, remember those characters you work with are real people. Those real people have real feelings, real issues, real strains, and real expectations. Their problems may not be yours, but they influence your workplace. Ted Baxter’s poor self-esteem took extra time to address on the show. In real life, Ted would likely have not lasted at that job. He was an albatross around the necks of too many hard-working coworkers. However, Ted is an example of how one person’s feelings and issues affect rapport development. Ted was someone to run from when he came into the room; and if you couldn’t run, you could at least roll your eyes and shake your head in disgust. Those reactions set a tone.</p> 
<p>One eye roll prompts another. It’s a pattern of acceptable responses learned at the workplace. Truth be told, you will eventually be someone for whom eyes will roll. Whether prompted by a word of praise you receive or your struggle to master a task, eyes will roll.</p> 
<p>Consider those real people who are bringing their real traits to the workplace. You don’t have to like them, but you do have to work with them. And unless there is something illegal, a violation of the employee handbook or generally toxic behavior, improving rapport development will benefit you.</p> 
<p>Secondly, decide to emphasize the positive. Consider what good someone in the office, in the restaurant, or in the warehouse brings to the table. You may have to stretch your mind a bit (for some, a lot) but chances are there will be at least one thing. Widen the view you have on that particular truth as you relate to that colleague. Bring up examples of &nbsp;that trait, talk about how it can be applied more at work and tell positive stories to others (within earshot of that colleague) highlighting how you noticed that quality in them. Often, that colleague will also start to look at herself/himself/themselves through a similar lens, at least while at work. That’s a good thing!</p> 
<p>And lastly, you’re not that wonderful. Ugh, this one stings. You see, your viewpoint is singular and because of that, you likely see things as they impact you and just you. It’s not intentional but natural. We are self-preserving creatures so labeling and defining others provides security for us and allows us to prepare a conversational response. Understand that your assessment isn’t necessarily wrong, but it is biased. Your personality and your past experiences, including tragedies and other bad circumstances, will influence how you receive someone. Own that and know you don’t have the only right perspective.</p> 
<p>There are times factions occur amongst a team. Often, they are born out of shared views of other people. Three colleagues dislike so-and-so, but you and a few others like so-and-so. That’s going to establish sides. The strength of those sides will vary, but they will, at the very least, influence rapport development. Everyone can’t be right, but everyone can be heard. Work through those relational hang-ups and foster basic respect amongst colleagues. You don’t have to be best friends with everyone at work, but you should try to get along!</p> 
<p>And while we may never work with a lovable, quirky crew like the team at WDJW on “The Mary Tyler Moore Show,” we can create a baseline for healthy rapport development. You can find someone to grab a meal with, even a few with whom you can laugh and cry. Whether in-person or virtually, put some spunk into building rapport and make a positive difference in your workplace.</p>

She was a spitfire who would curse you out (in Italian, of course) and didn’t miss anything going on…unless she wanted to miss what was going on. As a kid, I couldn’t understand how she would be able to hear some directed requests of her while not hearing others. I was so confused as to how she could overhear the quietest conversations but completely catch nothing in ones that included her. It wasn’t until I was older that I appreciated the practice.</p> 
<!--more--><p>Johnny Depp brought new life to Willy Wonka in 2005 in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. And while the Gene Wilder purists didn’t love this version, there were some great one-liners from Depp. “You really shouldn’t mumble” is a line we use in our home often. When Willy did not want to hear what someone else was saying, though he clearly heard it, he would retort with, “I can’t understand a word you’re saying.” For Mr. Wonka, mumblers were aplenty. It was deflection at its silliest.</p> 
<p>When we ignore others out of self-preservation, we do so to our own detriment. It’s often out of the uncomfortable that the turning of a new page or a refining process begins. So why do we do it?</p> 
<p>Well, that self-preservation piece is tough to ignore. We work hard to be our “best selves.” Take a look at your Facebook feed (if you still have one) and look at all of the memes, sayings and gifs encouraging you to <em>Live Your Best Life</em>, to cut out any negativity, to remove toxic people from your life. And while there is truth behind those mandates, are you prepared to know the difference, truly, between negativity and difficulty? Just because someone is sharing something you don’t want to hear does not make that person a negative force to be cut out of your life. And if social media is guiding that definition, I fear you’re blocking out potential growth opportunities (I, also, fear the depth that SoMe has on your life!).</p> 
<p>I remember being told I was a racist. It was actually the only time to date that I was directly called one. I sat across from the Vice President of Student Affairs and he simply, clearly and directly blasted me with that moniker. I was furious. Honestly, if I didn’t have a core respect for my elders, I likely would have introduced my fist to his face. I am not a racist. The one-minute exchange days earlier that he mentally categorized was the entire basis for his labelling despite a two-year history of working with me. And while I know that he was wrong, I can look at it differently today. I didn’t block him out. I didn’t file a lawsuit (though I could have as his label kept an RA position from being awarded to me). What I did instead was ask other people if I was sharing racist views or if people were uncomfortable around me due to a perception of racism. I didn’t want to hear what that VP said, but instead, I chose to listen and take from it what I could to be better.</p> 
<p>Choose to listen. As managers, it is easy to be dismissive. We can nod as if we’re listening (I mean, we’ve read enough books and attended enough seminars to know the tricks of listening), but choose to engage with what you hear, maybe even more with those views that differ from yours. The defensive posture of dismissal has a place, but it’s not the first tool to use. Consider the position first. Examine the basis for merit in process improvement, communications or goal alignment. Take the feedback. Listen.</p> 
<p>And I know it’s easy to read this and think about the people you’ve done that with and recall the disappointment in those relationships. Not everyone is right in what they ask you to listen to, and you will sift through those non-helpful comments. But taking the step to listen and consider first is fair and equitable. Mumblers don’t abound as much as Deflectors.</p>

Better question, have you played it well? There is a difference, and it would be wonderful if more played it ","2021-05-12 04:00:00","2023-07-11T17:14:31.223Z","<p>­­­The 360-feedback game. Have you played it? Better question, have you played it well? There is a difference, and it would be wonderful if more played it well. That’s no slight on any employee, per se, but rather more of a commentary on the receipt of organizational critique.</p> 
<!--more--> 
<p>Recently, I chatted with a few company founders. They each shared how they’d like to know what their staff are thinking. They spoke about a disconnect from where they sit and what is actually happening from the point of view of entry- to mid-level employees. Each shared various concerns about edited or muted commentary making its way back to them, whether due to managers keeping a lid on problems or a supervisor unsure as to when to bring things up. “Causing ripples in the water can be a death sentence,” one leader shared. “Who wants to be the person to cause a management meeting to go longer?”</p> 
<p>Ah, that starts to hit the nail, right? The idea of being the “troublemaker” on the management team by bringing up feedback or critique stymies the very kind of organizational health meant to be discussed at those meetings. A cycle of restraint leaving leaders thinking all is well in their company’s world (and heaven forbid a meeting go longer for a valid reason!).</p> 
<p>In <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119738/""><strong>My Best Friend’s Wedding</strong></a>, the premise of not sharing information is taken to a comedic and dark place. Julianne “Jules” (Julia Roberts) realizes that she loves her best friend, Michael (Dermot Mulroney), after he tells her he’s engaged to Kimberly “Kimmie” (Cameron Diaz). Maybe Jules should have figured things out years earlier, but now the chase is on (literally, across green fields and the city of Chicago) to share this feedback. She must tell him. And risk ruining everything.</p> 
<p>When feedback has as its primary consideration what <a href=""https://www.t-three.com/soak/insights/how-not-to-get-consumed-by-negative-feedback"">negative effect</a> it will cause, the mechanism is neither an effective tool nor likely to be utilized. Those leaders who shared with me were longing to know. All of them were sure that there were pieces of information that would greatly benefit the structure and/or the culture of the organization. Yet, the poor view of its effect on the deliverer of that feedback overshadowed the potential positive effects.</p> 
<p>For sure, all those leaders left our conversation feeling like they ought to take the first step by verbalizing a commitment to constructive feedback. That commitment needs to be more than just saying we want to listen but teaching management how to seek and receive it. Often, the breakdown is in the employee-to-supervisor level. There is very little, if any, training offered to supervisors as to how to maturely ask for and receive feedback. Supervisors are usually in a tactical space getting work done and are not encouraged to consider first level transformational information gathering. When “feedback” is synonymous with “complaint,” then supervisors will knee-jerk into shutting any commentary down. They think that’s what they ought to do, that the company would want them to stop any complaining. Supervisors will do better if they know better, truly.</p> 
<p>And it’s okay for small steps towards improvement to be made in feedback gathering. Manage your expectation for everyone’s adoption of the “new way” we do things. Feedback connects to an employee’s trust quotient. Can they really believe you want to know? If it’s been years of suppression or fear, then expecting an overnight change is foolish. Take it in incremental steps.</p> 
<p>Expectations have to be managed at the onset of feedback as well as on the back end. Jules did not get Michael after she shared her feelings. He still married Kimmie. If staff believe that whatever feedback they offer will be met with immediate action or complete acceptance by all involved, then disappointment will set in and detract from the offering of critique. Why bother if they don’t change? Tackle those expectations, too.</p> 
<p>This is not an easy boat to turn around. It will take time and a supportive team to implement. I’ll say a little prayer for you along the way…</p>

When you ask someone where they’ve been and the response from that person is “out,” do you accept that final answer? It’s most common for you to say something like, “Out where?” You want a complete, honest answer, and even more so when you get that kind of initial response!</p> 
<!--more--><p>Feedback is supposed to be honest. Not mean, not sugar-coated, not inflammatory, but honest. And yet, when we receive it, we may be tempted to refuse it because we don’t believe it to be true. The defense mechanisms kick in. We begin to search our minds for reasons to push back. We may verbalize arguments against it or attacks on the deliverer of the feedback. And those of you reading now who are finding themselves already posturing against this being you might need to re-evaluate. It’s called a natural defense mechanism for a reason.</p> 
<p>As with most conditional responses, whether a mental or overt response, there are some behavioral modification techniques that will help (watch out <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._F._Skinner"">BF Skinner</a>-ites…about to get good!).</p> 
<ul>
 <li><strong>Context Consideration</strong> – walk through the context of the feedback thoughtfully. Are these feedback points clearly about the work that that I do for the company? If so, then keep the context narrow. These comments may not be indicative of a global truth about me. They represent only how the work I do is offered and/or received. My context is that I have an audience to the work I do, and I want to be sure to deliver so it’s received well. And while it may feel personal (and maybe some of it is), ultimately, it’s about my role.</li>
</ul> 
<ul>
 <li><strong>Address Negative Bias</strong> – hearing the term “feedback” may be elicit a conditioned response of presumed negativity. You hear any commentary, whether truly negative/constructive or, in fact, positive, through a lens of “OK, what’s he/she/they getting at?” Expecting the worst, or at least close to it, means hearing the worst. Even, “I see so much progress in your skills this year” is heard as a slight. “Oh, you mean, I wasn’t skilled before?” It’s a defensive posture, usually heightened from some previous experiences that were not healthy. Not every manager is out to get you. Confront that bias head on as you hear information. Call out the negative tape playing in your head.</li>
</ul> 
<ul>
 <li><strong>Framing</strong> – Listen to both affirmational and constructive feedback for opportunities to frame a further plan of action for development or for display. How can I take these points and create opportunities for excellence? By framing a plan forward, the current feedback is not the end, but rather a means to further opportunity. Without framing, the feedback may be seen as the end of the path. As you may have seen in coworkers, when that happens, the employee settles into an “I guess I’ve reached my potential here” or “I am not giving any more than I do since they don’t appreciate it” position. Framing looks for deeper development and chances for innovative application.</li>
</ul> 
<p>Starting with these few techniques will change the entire feedback process for you, both as a receiver AND a deliverer. You will be more considerate and intentional about feedback you offer. You will proactively look for ways to deliver your messaging in feedback to be affirmational in continuous improvement and creative opportunities. And you won’t rely on sugar-coating difficult feedback, but rather, you will have first-hand understanding of behavioral modification techniques that you can weave into the delivery of information. Those who report to you will appreciate that kind of thoughtfulness.</p> 
<p>Feedback isn’t code for “you suck.” But if the message received is truly one of “maybe this isn’t the role for you,” then isn’t it good to know that and frame a plan moving forward to seek out a more aligned role? That’s not negative; it’s saving you time (years, maybe) from staying in a job that you’re not designed for. If you think about it that way, you actually received positive feedback.</p>

"Humareso Blog","Knowing Me Knowing You","Knowing Me Knowing You – Humareso","en","https://blog.humareso.com/knowingmeknowingyou","John Baldino","","Knowing how to work the angles in the workplace is a skill set in and of itself, often separate from the skills needed to actually do one’s job. Sigourney ","2021-04-15 04:00:00","2022-05-26T21:09:07.775Z","<p>Knowing how to work the angles in the workplace is a skill set in and of itself, often separate from the skills needed to actually do one’s job. Sigourney Weaver played Katharine Parker, one of the worst bosses in the history of the world, in the movie <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096463/""><strong>Working Girl</strong></a>. She knew how to work these angles and took professional advantage of her assistant, Tess McGill (Melanie Griffith’s character). Katharine was able to use cunning innovation, strategic planning and creative thinking to her benefit. Of course, since the movie had to have an underdog happy ending, she lost out in the end, but far too many of us know that is not always (usually?) the case in actual organizations.</p> 
<!--more--><p>Have you ever thought about those online and email virus creators? What an incredible set of skills and knowledge to put to use for such a devious outcome. Aren’t there some private company or public entity roles that these people could be given to use their powers for good instead of evil?</p> 
<p>For most managers, encouraging the application of individual competencies is way down on the To Do List. Just getting the work done takes precedence daily. There may be production quotas to fill or customer activity that requires constant attention and service. Time marches on, and despite a desire to know and apply individual competencies, it doesn’t happen.</p> 
<p>The two-sided nature of a process called competency mapping, particularly in a climate of heightened, competitive talent acquisition and robust organizational growth, will put this task on a healthier and directed path for necessary completion. The first side of the process is to assess the individual competencies – defined as knowledge, skills, aptitude, abilities and personal attributes – through a short series of information gathering. For instance, the use of survey software to ask managers what they observe (behaviors give insight into the application of competencies) in each staff member. Whether those competencies are directly related to the role held by the individual contributor is irrelevant. What have you seen this person do or be?</p> 
<p>On the self-identification side, the same survey platform can be used to ask employees about what they know how to do and how they know they can do it. This information gathering can also take the form of a more organizational psychology approach through scientific assessments. Engaging an IO Specialist or a seasoned HR practitioner may help to get this done. Ultimately, this will draw out the functional skills applied to the work being done as well as to work that could be done. It will put forth knowledge that the individual has, the demeanor with which work is done and the leadership, if any, put forth to accomplish objectives.</p> 
<p>This becomes an inventory to draw upon as well as an alignment check to the actual role assigned. Herein is the other side of the coin. What competencies does it take to perform each role the company has? Map the competencies for the role itself, without looking at the person filling the role currently. This one can be tricky because it’s tough to separate, but it allows for a more holistic and honest review of what is needed for successful management, completion and/or performance of the job. Just because someone is in a role, even if in that role for years, does not mean the person is aligned to the work being done well. Remember working the angles?</p> 
<p>Haven’t you heard staff ask, “How did So &amp; So get that job?” And usually that question is not asked in a positive light! It’s a question of alignment. In order to appreciate the how, the question to first ask is the what. What does it take for someone to be successful in this role? What competencies does the person currently in the role have? Do they match up?</p> 
<p>Don’t let the title of the exercise – competency mapping – throw you. Yes, it takes directed effort to complete this and may require an outside resource to help, but it’s absolutely worth it in the long run. It will, also, help to move people like Katharine Parker out of the organization quicker. She had to go!</p>

"Humareso Blog","Kiss Off","Kiss Off – Humareso","en","https://blog.humareso.com/kiss-off","John Baldino","","It was never a taught skill, but someone how my sister and I mastered egging each other into a frenzy. My mom loved it (insert sarcastic face). On good day","2021-04-01 04:00:00","2022-05-26T21:10:39.938Z","<p>It was never a taught skill, but someone how my sister and I mastered egging each other into a frenzy. My mom loved it (insert sarcastic face). On good days, she would call one of us a “tantalizer.” We just knew how to get under each other’s skin. When I watch Erica, Barry and Adam Goldberg interact, I am reminded of those glorious days of arguing, punching, smacking and annoying. <a href=""https://abc.com/shows/the-goldbergs""><strong>The Goldbergs</strong></a> recreates those darling interactions between siblings in a heartfelt but true-to-form manner. It seems so effortless for them, too. I get it. Being naturally proficient in this was my joy as a kid (ok, a little bit now, too). But I know I am not alone in my mastery. Funny how it’s not a listed skill set on resumes today.</p> 
<!--more--><p>Well, perhaps, while not appearing on CVs, we do find ways to put forth this expertise in the workplace. The Human Resources Department is sometimes full of these expert tantalizers. And the most valuable weapons aren’t headlock nuggys anymore; it’s write-ups.</p> 
<p>Through the years, when I have been privileged enough to come into an organization and establish a path for both individual and company development and progression, I’ve come face to face with the weaponizing use of discipline. And I get it. When HR is setup as a default discipline within an organization, the investment in skill development is minimal, if not non-existent. Companies relegate these de facto HR POCs (points of contact) into discipline machines – “you’re late, you’re not in uniform, you’re out of PTO, you’re not…” The list of infractions multiplies as the employee handbook grows from 30 pages to 70 and changes into a handbook of grievances. YAY, let’s work here!</p> 
<p>Corrective action rather than employee discipline is the right consideration, but even that has become more about correction and less about action. Renaming the task of writing people up but doing the same thing is the old smoke and mirrors gag. Your staff knows it.</p> 
<p>So, what do you do? Simple. How would you like to be treated?</p> 
<p>Take the last 6 incidents where write-ups occurred and place yourself in the recipient’s shoes. Block the judgement about the actual individual for a moment. Consider instead the areas of expectation management, communication, job duties and performance. Focus on the role and the manner with which you understand the work to be done. Could it be that there are gaps in understanding or in the actual function of the role that have caused discipline to be the solution?</p> 
<p>Look, if I am asked to come to the plate and hit a home run every time I’m at bat, there is a high probability that I will fail. Whether you are a baseball aficionado or not, you can appreciate this example. No one hits a home run every time. No one. But if that is how the expectation is setup and performance is measured, then write-ups will be aplenty. Does an employee who has been disciplined have such an expectation? I know you’re shaking your head no but stop and look at the situation. Could the department manager be someone who is hard to please? If someone has “failed” in the past, is the hole so deep for that person to climb out of that the manager won’t ever be satisfied? And before you think it could never be this, it’s likely this 50% of the time.</p> 
<p>Simply, stop with the write-ups. Yes, yes, there are things that need to be documented. I could not have made it 30 years in HR-related work without appreciating a “note to file.” Instead, the first thought ought to be. “Let’s chat, Employee. What’s happening with you? The issue we have to discuss is based on “x”, but I wonder if there’s more to it. Can you help me to understand why “x” isn’t happening?” (or something similar). You already know, for instance, that the person has been late to work a few times. Can we just ask what’s up before we commence with the over-the-top dead-arm torture of the “1<sup>st</sup> Written Warning”?</p> 
<p>And before any solidarity movement around how much employees suck comes my way, let me affirm that not every employee will respond well to this initial tactic. Some may just want the write-up and then, on the next shift, no call/no show for a final kiss off to you. Been there, done that. However, it’s still in our right interest to hope for the best. Notice I didn’t finish that with “and expect the worst.” Change the mindset, Tantalizer.</p>

Being in human resources related work for almost 30 years gives you too many opportunities to see and to hear how awful people can be to one another. Truly awful. It’s a running joke that all good HR professionals keep tissues on their desk, not for themselves necessarily, but for the stream of people who come in with pain on their faces and strain in their voices. Workplaces can be glorified high schools, yes, but mostly they remind us that the human dynamic can be quite broken and in need of guidance.</p> 
<!--more--><p>When the show <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1327801/"">Glee</a> hit, I was hooked in the first two minutes. As a hopeful singer with little talent, living vicariously through these characters who were trying to find their way in high school while dealing with the unpopular choice to be in a glee club was inspiring. However, it was a painful experience for each. While having a slushie dumped on you or being tossed into a dumpster were extreme peer responses, the verbal assaults and gossiping were a more common weapon. The glee club students were brought to tears on more than one episode and for a variety of reasons ranging from “you’re just not cool anymore” to taunting about race, disability and being adopted. Sound like your company? I hope not, but I see your head nodding yes.</p> 
<p>It’s a remarkable feat to instill confidence in those who have been broken by any system of oppression and relegation. Helping others to find their voice while concurrently dismantling modalities of process and behavior that demoralize and keep certain types of people out is a mandate for the leaders in any healthy organization. If that’s not a hallmark for those in leadership, then is it a healthy organization?</p> 
<p>Recently, I spoke to an organization that was having trouble with one of its founders. This owner was rough. He spoke disparagingly to staff. He wouldn’t curse at a person, but curse to a person (yes, this was really the explanation). Rather than, “You’re a f*$@* idiot,” a gentler, kinder version – “Do you have any idea why you would put this f*$@* information in the wrong place.” See? Isn’t that much better? After a couple of years of dealing with this, an employee has had enough. She complained and said it’s got to stop. The answer? Let’s make the owner sit through an hour of training to fix him. That should make it better.</p> 
<p>While training is a good tool, it’s not the complete solution. I asked, “Does the owner see the problem?” Thankfully, the Zoom video chat allowed me to see the head-shaking “no” response. So what in the world will training for an hour do? And knowing that there won’t be a change coming, that complaining employee stopped coming to work. Likely, there’s more to come here…</p> 
<p>What will it take to get serious about breaking down systemic dividers amongst departments? Or more to the point, amongst people? Does it have to take a severe course of action for an individual to be heard at your workplace? Do they need to be stuffed into a locker? Truly, every manager and HR professional ought to be on the forefront proactively looking for ways to better manage effective and targeted communication, workplace relational development and a respectful inclusive environment full of vitality. We can no longer accept any sort of status quo when it comes to organizational health. Whether it’s an Owner, a C-Suite Executive, a first-time Supervisor or an Entry Level worker, all have a right to be treated respectfully and to offer respect in return.</p> 
<p>If you’re struggling in your workplace, I am sorry. No one has the right to rain on your parade. You are valued and there is an inclusive place for you. Whether it’s with your current employer or not, there is a way for you to use your giftedness freely with the support of those around you. Find those champions who will speak confidence into you. You will learn, if not already happening, how to trust those people. You still need honest feedback. I need those I trust to tell me, “John, you’re awesome, but trying to release your first CD might not be the best route for you. Unless that CD is spoken word.”</p> 
<p>I’ll take that support. And you should have it as well.</p>

Ah, take that vision in.</p> 
<!--more--><p>And then watch “The Lottery Changed My Life.” It’s a sad tale (usually) of overspending, overextending and overexposure. Dysfunctional approaches to instant wealth based upon psychological baggage riddle the show. Lots of “I can’t believe I am broke again” head-shaking along with bankruptcy lawsuits make for 30-60 minutes of entertainment (maybe?).</p> 
<p>And as typical viewing Americans, we shake our heads at the screen explaining to our television viewing living room audience how this situation would never happen to me. We explain how we wouldn’t fall into the traps these people did and how we’re much smarter than all of this. We think we know better. That’s what we do. Especially in areas where we have no direct experience. Did you ever notice that?</p> 
<p>We build upon the premise of knowing, in general, how far is too far. We take the victories we’ve had in life and paint with a broad and bold brush. And while there are some truths that are universal that our experiences have driven home, projecting every opinion or position as absolute truth will likely cause issues, particularly when it comes to dealing with others.</p> 
<p>Welcome to the daily “dilemma” organizations face as they ask for collaboration and expression of ideas while maintaining the boundaries of “this is too far.”</p> 
<p>Companies say they are looking for “better” employees. I’ve been in these leadership meetings where idealism breaks down into despair about the state of our world. “These kids today” kind of language, pointing out the lack of critical thinking, babied responsiveness and minimum willingness to work hard.&nbsp; Fractional leadership may be brought in to help, but too often manifests itself in platitudes of what used to work and how life was better then.</p> 
<p>Is the basis of leadership in our organizations merely pointing out how far is too far?</p> 
<p>We’ve likely read the research that top-down leadership desiring to affect organizational cultural change <a href=""https://hbr.org/2017/06/changing-company-culture-requires-a-movement-not-a-mandate"">fails</a> most times. In an effort to fix what is wrong with process and/or product, the personnel attached to these areas are discussed. Behaviors, work ethic and viable knowledge sharing are areas of discussion. And then leadership decides to “crack the whip” “make an example of a few” “introduce a new sheriff in town” or some such tone-deaf, if not offensive, phraseology of yesteryear.</p> 
<p>To think inspiration will come from that kind of approach is more laughable today than even ten years ago, thankfully. But as with many human responses, we can swing the pendulum too far in the opposite direction. Leaders want to push transparency and humility as company values in fostering creative, inventive staff contributions. Recent research shows that these organizations are running a higher risk of “<a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/niharchhaya/2020/05/07/how-to-know-if-your-humility-has-gone-too-far/?sh=3ad0f3066723"">too much humility</a>” through self-deprecation leading to employee concern over a lack of leadership competencies. Terms like weak, unsure and incompetent creep into employee survey responses when asked about leadership’s ability to lead people and/or process.</p> 
<p>And the shocking answer to much of this is a positional commitment to balance. How might I demonstrate clear organizational direction while maintaining an expressed desire for collaborative input? Think about how that question might be received and answered by the leaders in your own company.</p> 
<p>One final reality is the too-oft used personality crutch. The belief is that to balance such an approach is dependent upon a leader with a certain type of personality. True, certain natural leanings will make this balanced approach easier to cultivate; however, that is not the same as saying it’s not possible for leaders of varying personalities to be successful. Extroverts and introverts, whatever your DISC profile or Myers-Briggs alphabet, can achieve a non-punitive, non-authoritarian, innovatively collaborative leadership brand within an organization. Don’t believe the personality excuse.</p> 
<p>Is it a good idea for any contributor in the organization to know where the gutters of the bowling lane are? Of course. Is it a good idea for any contributor to understand where the company is going with reasonable transparency? Most definitely.&nbsp; Can both be done without leadership flexing in extremes? Absolutely.&nbsp;</p>

For a business, having staff that are able to innovate and experiment as part of their job duties fosters the kind of whole-hearted investment leaders desire in their teams. It’s not to say that all your employees will do is to innovate. Of course, there are response duties to be done, but their willingness to do better and to perform more efficiently will increase. This supportive environment changes those participating. “How can I help?” becomes the mantra more often.</p> 
<!--more--><p>And lest we think it’s a one-sided relationship, ask yourself, what are the ways the company is doing to provide ways to be innovative? There does not have to be a quantitative answer to this, but are there ones to point to? Having the expectation fall squarely and only on the employee to bring an “A Game” to each day without much, if any, of an expectation for the organization to perform similarly is not an equation for success. The lopsided nature of this is too often the reality of organizations. Hence the performance management process fraught with PIPs, not leading to vibrant change, but too often leading to separation.</p> 
<p>A couple of years ago, a CEO of a 17-million-dollar company with about 250 employees shared with me that he was frustrated with the team around him. “I pay these people to do their best and to bring new ideas to the table. They’re lazy and have become too comfortable. I want to refresh the team.” And while his frustration was real and he needed to have an outlet to share, this CEO needed to expand his view. “If I may, what do you think the organization has in place to foster these creative and innovative opportunities?” At first, the CEO was perplexed by my response. “What do you mean, John? I pay them quite well.”</p> 
<p>Therein lies a classic rub – I pay you, therefore, be awesome. While money is a factor, for certain, it does not lead to a straight-line cause and effect for innovation, among other areas. In what ways does the environment lend itself to innovation? How often is creativity a topic in a Weekly 30 meeting? For those EOS adopters, does this area appear in your Level 10 meetings? Without cultivating and caring for innovation as a living being, it will die, often before it ever really gets started.</p> 
<p>How often have you hired someone and told them the lies about wanting their creativity? OUCH. But think about it. We source for and bring in new talent that we want to shake things up, to add value to what we’ve already built, to inspire others with fresh ideas…and then we show them a cubicle and tell them, effectually, to assimilate through rigid policy and inflexible workflow process.</p> 
<p>What we need to do is foster creativity on both sides of the equation. Start with a few simple ideas:</p> 
<ul>
 <li><strong>Ask</strong> – Gather staff and ask them what they need to approach current work more creatively or to develop new ideas more consistently. Some of your best ideas are already there just waiting for permission to share. Set the expectation that not all ideas may be feasible but be prepared to offer a reason why. And if you find yourself saying no to most ideas, the faucet of innovation will dry up quickly. No one wants to hear “no” repeatedly.</li>
</ul> 
<ul>
 <li><strong>Develop</strong> – When you have a couple of ideas to run with, have a few from the team help you to develop them. Consider what resources – time, space, funds, safety – will be needed to make it happen. When you present these details to the team, they get to help decide on application of those resources. This will deepen their buy-in for the overall vision. Yes, it may mean that not everything can be put in place now, but having the team think critically about what matters today drives innovation. They will already be thinking iteratively as a result of considering highest needs.</li>
</ul> 
<ul>
 <li><strong>Test</strong> – Give the team space to test out their ideas. Being creative does not mean that success happens at every try. Failure is a teacher. If you can allow for missteps and re-dos, to a degree, then the team is more likely to be free to innovate.&nbsp; Without safety in experimentation, the desire for new ideas and approaches will be replaced by a desire to stay off the radar and to not get into trouble. And that is a limiter to creativity in business.</li>
</ul> 
<p>After that CEO considered our conversation a bit more, he shared the lack of creative environment in the organization as a whole. “I haven’t given permission for teams to be creative. I only ask about what their responsive work is like and how quickly they can get it done. Frankly, I keep saying we’re busy and that means there’s no time for anything else.” He revamped one department at a time to encourage opportunities to ideate. See? People can learn. Not every time, but sometimes…</p>

Whether it was due to certain statewide pandemic mandates and their impact on businesses or due to the inability of an organization to pivot into other types of product or service delivery or just a desire for change, many people have transitioned to a new role over the past year. And a deliberate theme I have heard often in these transitions – “I had enough.”</p> 
<!--more--><p>Hearkening back some years, I can recall being in a role where my amenable disposition was leveraged to keep systemic broken process relationships in place. Conflict simmered throughout the organization and it was my job to help fix all the issues. Knowing that I would want to do an exceptional job, the CEO continued to put me into positions of “coaching” with staff members to get them to feel better about the work they needed to do and the people involved in getting it done. This CEO didn’t specify this as the plan, but as the months and years progressed, it all came to me one night with such clarity that I was dumbstruck as to how I could have missed it for so long. As such, I reached the “I had enough” threshold fairly quickly and transitioned to a new organization.</p> 
<p>In <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0964517/""><strong>The Fighter</strong></a>, Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg) realizes that his boxing career has been stunted by his family. His brother and mother are his trainer and manager respectively, and they have worked Micky over more than any of his boxing competitors. They have had him fight out of his division (get pummeled rather than fight, more like it) and sacrifice his future for their desires. Micky wakes up to the reality through his new girlfriend’s help. He breaks from his family’s dysfunctional influence in order to do his best work in the ring.</p> 
<p>And that’s what each of us must get to. OK, fine, you’ve been a fool in the past. Maybe you’re a fool now. But you can stop. If the “professional” environment has you playing a role that you did not sign up for, then it may be time for a change.</p> 
<p>Flippant as these words may seem, there is only one chance you get to live the life you have. Listening to the pained stories of the past year where highly seasoned professionals “woke up” to see their organization’s misaligned values and toxic culture was sad. It’s not as if these professionals were impaired from seeing it sooner, but often the desire to perform work well blinded them from some of the signs. Many of you are fixers. You want your work to be more than mere tasks, but also, about transforming organizations. There are times you are able to do that. There are times it’s the right thing to do. And there are times enough is enough.</p> 
<p>And don’t worry about what others may say. They don’t know what you’ve been experiencing. You know the path you’ve had to travel and the circumstances surrounding it. So what if some people on Facebook “talk” about your seemingly odd decision? Social Media is distracting plenty of people from facing their own “enough” thresholds. It’s much easier to judge others from a distance than to deal with the miles you’ve been walking and take action.</p> 
<p>Who are those you could turn to and talk out what’s going on at your company? Where are those business guides in your life? Do you know what to look for?</p> 
<p>Finding yourself playing the fool is not a crime. Once you realize it, you may need to forgive yourself. You may be tempted towards depression over how foolish you’ve been or towards disbelief as to how you could have missed it for so long. Offer yourself reprieve. You now know better and that makes today the start of a new approach, a new direction or a completely new chapter. Put those gloves back on and get into the ring on your terms. There is still fight left in you. It just needs to be focused in a better direction. You may be down, the ref may be at 6 in a 10-count, but you can get up and get out of that fight. Find the championship role for you.</p>

There, I said it.</p> 
<!--more--><p>In a purely unscientific poll, we discovered that the first impression HR gives to many employees, in various geographies and industries, is one of disdain. Frustrated HR people answer the phone or respond to an email with a “tone.” And those air quotes are not meant to be kind.</p> 
<p>In my own life, I can recall deliberately changing my tone after answering a phone call with a gruff “Hello” when I realized it was my boss or the CEO. Otherwise, I may have stayed cranky due to how busy I was. Somehow, my packed schedule and full to-do list was justification for trying to rush an employee off the phone or be dismissive to a department supervisor via email. It was immature and authoritarian in ways it needed not be.</p> 
<p>How did we do this to ourselves? I know that not every HR person acts this way. I had to retrain myself to approach communication differently. We have success stories, for sure. But the reputation still precedes us, HR. We’re cranky more than we’re not.</p> 
<p>The one-liners from <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107050/""><strong>Grumpy Old Men</strong></a> are some of the best the former Odd Couple duo could launch. Truth be told, there may have been one or two that some of us would want to say to a few people around us. Walter Matthau’s character shouting, “Do me a favor. Put your lip over your head and swallow” is deliciously apropos for our most challenging staff. The movie may provide a temporary outlet for such verbal desires, but it ought not to be the theme for the HR Department!</p> 
<p>Knowing better does not mean we do better. Be attentive to the way you’re saying what you say. Basic, right? You may have even given that advice to a new manager or the CFO, but how have you applied it to yourself? Re-read that email before you send it. Take a breath before you answer the phone. Review what you plan to say to an employee with an HR colleague or neutral party. Again, these are familiar tactics, but are you doing them? Any self-checks happening?</p> 
<p>Maybe today, you can ask a few employees from different areas within the organization to comment on what they think about HR. Ask. And be sure to set the table of safety and confidentiality, if possible, so that the most honest opportunity for feedback would occur. Especially if HR is seen as a distant “bunch of cops,” the likelihood of complete transparency is doubtful. The exercise needs to be worth the time for all involved.</p> 
<p>Be encouraged, though, that we can do better. If we’ve made some missteps, own them. Ask for forgiveness and share the better plan/approach that you’ll have. There’s more graciousness in our organizations than we may believe. Step into it. And keep the “moron” comments to yourself.</p>

With MegaMillions offering a jackpot of $490 million (as of the date of this blog), the possibility of Easy Street excites more people. There are those regulars who will play each week for the chance to win $40 million, but once that pot multiplies, lots more people become interested enough to play. Dreaming of what that win will do to life is enough to motivate. Of course, $40 million is nothing to sneeze at, but statistically, we’re a people that need high stakes to inspire us to action.</p> 
<!--more--><p>When incentive plans are developed in organizations, this kind of human drive is forgotten, or at least, minimized. About ten years ago, <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704304504574610220160969020"">Hammond’s Candies</a> used to incentivize employees to find cost-cutting measures in production. Within a short time period, ten employees provided either real improvement ideas that were implemented or actual cost of goods reductions. The company was thrilled at the response. Hammond’s Candies paid out $500 for all 10 of those implemented ideas that saved the company thousands of dollars. For those not as quick with math, that means each of the 10 employees received $50. Guess how many new savings ideas were offered after this first crop?</p> 
<p>Asking for innovation should inspire people. Consider first, however, the environment. Does your work environment foster such creativity? If it’s a brand new idea, work with a small team of cross-sectional staff to define this new opportunity and how it will function. It’s okay to have a couple of ringers at the onset to create a tone for what it should look like. Staff will respond more favorably if they have an example of how innovation and creativity are defined.</p> 
<p>If compensation is going to be offered (lean towards it should), be kind and reasonable. Saving the organization $4500 annually might be worth more than $50. And while the savings may seem small to you (in comparison to the company’s overall budget), it is not small to the employee who spent time considering how to help. What would 10% of that savings as an incentive really cost? It wouldn’t. Allow the incentive to align to the impact. It’s not necessarily true that 10% should always be the factor, so you can have a sliding scale or some levels of incentive offering. Work with your cross-sectional team to help define this area, too. Having buy-in will ensure its launch and its participation.</p> 
<p>And be sure those involved have an understanding of budgets, savings…numbers as a whole. You may have to explain some of the “basics.” Don’t assume everyone is working from the same point of reference. One of my favorite scenes from Arrested Development involves Lindsay, Maeby and Michael Bluth:</p> 
<p><em>Lindsay: Ok, I tell you what. I'll take you down to see Nana if you split the money with me 60-40.</em></p> 
<p><em>Maeby: 55-55.</em></p> 
<p><em>Lindsay: Deal.</em></p> 
<p><em>Michael: Sounds like you guys are getting more than you think.</em></p> 
<p>It is good to explain why someone saving the company $4500 should not necessarily get that $4500 (if you do offer that, great, but there could be other reasons not to do that). Truthfully, this may be the first time someone is exposed to a P&amp;L and to budgets. Embrace the opportunity to explain kindly.</p> 
<p>Remember, too, that these ideas are not merit-based incentives. Someone having a stand-alone idea for savings or improvement does not mean that the same person is performing consistently in the main areas of the work to be done. Reward the idea and its implementation. Save merit increases for an overall work review.</p> 
<p>Innovation is a value to the organization. Rewarding it is appropriate. Incentivizing it poorly will constrict creativity as quickly as its encouraged. These ideas are not likely to put an employee on Easy Street; save that option for MegaMillions.</p>

Hallelujah. It’s the end of 2020. 1.5 million people have died worldwide due to COVID-19 complications. Equity came defiantly front and center forcing a mirror to be held up to each of us. Jobs were lost, hospitals were full, rents were past due and restaurants faced a hurdle the size of the Comcast Tower. And it’s not over yet. We lost Kobe, RBG, Chadwick and Alex. A sense of stability shaken to the core more times than we could count. But we’re here.</p> 
<!--more--><p>And what we know is that we can. With passionate optimism or desperate pleading, we searched “why” more times on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rokGy0huYEA&amp;feature=youtu.be"">Google</a> in 2020 than any other word. We wanted to know, and knowing leads to learning. Learning leads to activation. And activation leads to purpose and passion. We can get back to these two elements even in the worst of times. We can.</p> 
<p>We’ve done so after wars, bombings, plagues and economic ruin. We’ve responded through the tears with vibrancy and relevance. We matter and we want to flourish. Change may need to come or more attention may need to be paid. We look for ways to remind and rekindle. We stoke fires and make a meal out of crumbs. We can exhibit resiliency and brokenness concurrently. We can.</p> 
<p>And we know that the road is not rosy. There is not an idyllic way to normalize pain, desperation or depravity, nor should there be. We face it, with tears, clenched fists and painful screams, but we face it. We rise despite. 2020 is not to define us; it’s to direct us in what we can do together. We can overturn systems, renew efforts and come together with kindness and conviction. We can expect the best out of one another as we expect in return. We can.</p> 
<p>We hope, not for some fantasy, but for the reality of strong character fostering graciousness, understanding and compassion. We are not a people looking for a handout, but rather a people working to advance our condition, our position and our contribution.&nbsp; We can move beyond our pain without forgetting or losing what it’s done to us as we seek health and betterment. We can.</p> 
<p>And while we hope for a better 2021, we know that we will likely face loss, death and uncertainty just as we’ve done in years previous. The situations and circumstances will vary and will require a renewed energy, but we can operate based upon our history of flexibility, camaraderie and courage. We can be brave in climbing over the hurdle and creating new opportunities while finding stability in a bleak landscape. We can see more than our eyes show us. We have done this before, and we can do it again. We can.</p> 
<p><em>(I will be back in 2021 with more human resources, business management, talent acquisition and HR technology content. I wish you all a blessed holiday season and a renewed strength for the new year)</em></p>

Isn’t it a lovely din?</p> 
<!--more--><p>In many organizations, a portion of the stress is found in the characterization funnel regarding worth. And before you conjure up beer funnel images of your college bravado, a characterization funnel is quite different. It’s the forced subjective employee personality and effort review that management creates through calendar-based compensation incentives. During this time of year, bonuses and raises may be offered and require managers to determine what and how much.</p> 
<p>Of course, if you ask most organizational leaders, they may share the objective-based criteria used in offering those bonuses. They will regale you with tales as to how much effort went into developing these performance-based metrics and deciding upon which areas to measure. It’s a beautiful tale of meetings and emails validating some sort of “process” mechanic. But truth be told, much of that gathered data is then filtered through the characterization funnel, and its veracity is tarnished.</p> 
<p>Managers don’t want to end the year by demotivating hard-working team members by crushing their hopes for a certain amount of bonus, or even a bonus at all. “Happy Holidays, Fred. I know you’ve increased productivity by 15%, but to qualify for a bonus, you had to have increased it by 23%. So sorry, but thanks for trying.” Really? Who wants to tell someone that? Usually not the supervisor.</p> 
<p>Instead, we tweak the results. “While it may be true that productivity was measured at a 15% increase, we have to give credit to Fred because he lost two employees during the peak season. He really stepped up. I think he should get the bonus in light of that.” Have you been in the room for these conversations? Yes. Yes, you have. So, what’s the answer?</p> 
<ol type=""1"">
 <li><strong>Know what you want to truly measure and why:</strong> Stop picking arbitrary metrics. 30% increase…based on what? If there’s never been a history of anyone increasing by 30% and there are no substantive changes to process or materials/service, then why is that a reasonable performance goal? Have valid and reliable reasons for the measurement selected.</li>
</ol> 
<ul>
 <li><strong>Spread it out:</strong> Instead of having the one time of year to validate someone’s contribution, spread out the incentive opportunities quarterly, monthly, etc. The funnel happens because it’s a rush of employees all at once. Within this, bias will occur. Oh, he’s trying, she’s had some setbacks, etc. Excuses come in that invalidate the criteria that was setup. And lest you think this is symptomatic of a certain size or type of industry, it happens across the board. People dealing with people when the pressure of livelihoods, the time of year and wanting to keep peace all collide lead to subjective decision-making and bias pitfalls.</li>
</ul> 
<ul>
 <li><strong>Be incremental:</strong> Perhaps an all or nothing approach isn’t the best option. Instead of one number to hit, is there value in stepped improvement? There is. Moving to a 10% increase in productivity, while pushing towards a 30% overall, is a win. Maybe assigning a portion of incentive-based pay for such a milestone is appropriate. Everything wouldn’t have to wait for the end of year funnel.&nbsp;</li>
</ul> 
<p>Think through these initial steps and challenge the reliability of the current year-end process. Fight the characterization funnel and move beyond old school thinking. There are 12 months in a year. 12. Share the love throughout the year.</p>

"Humareso Blog","Lust for Life","Lust for Life – Humareso","en","https://blog.humareso.com/lustforlife","John Baldino","","The idea of going can be a difficult one. Yes, there may be enthusiasm for what next adventure or reality awaits, but the act of going requires fortitude. ","2020-11-18 05:00:00","2022-05-26T21:12:37.809Z","<p>The idea of going can be a difficult one. Yes, there may be enthusiasm for what next adventure or reality awaits, but the act of going requires fortitude. Some may say it’s just one foot in front of the other; others find it paralyzing as they fret over what might be. It does not feel the same for everyone involved. Even in this, some are late bloomers, some peak early. Regardless, moving forward is challenging.</p> 
<!--more--><p>COVID, the political landscape, the economy...take your pick from these or a host of others for 2020 and you’ll have some sense of why the difficulty in going is strong. The offbeat comedy, <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0265666/""><strong>The Royal Tenenbaums</strong></a>, dealt with roadblocks of the unknown and unmotivated. Each character, flawed to the extreme, found themselves stymied and hovering. Taking that next step was debilitating. Some characters had found success early in life, while some were waiting for any success. None of them knew how to cope, plan and move forward.</p> 
<p>The 4<sup>th</sup> quarter of a calendar year opens the door to creatively plan for the following year. Approaching the newness with goals, objectives, vision, mission updates, etc. feels more natural. It’s like hyped-up resolutions, but these have teeth and real heart. They become mantras and signposts. They need your attention to develop.</p> 
<p>Developing this vision takes effort. While there are an abundance of tools out there to help you, a favorite from <a href=""https://community.pepperdine.edu/hr/content/development/vision_statement.pdf"">Pepperdine University</a> may be the best one to start with as a newbie. The purpose is not to outline every single goal you have, but rather, to define what the overall trajectory of your life is to be about, whether immediate (under 5 years) or longer term. SMART Goals and the like will follow, but without the foundation of an ultimate truth to be run after, those goals can be disjointed and, sometimes, competing. The energy and effort expended should be used wisely and towards one main reality.</p> 
<p>Goal setting is contextual; vision building is definitional.</p> 
<p>In some ways, vision building is a mental health exercise. Taking an inventory of where you are, what is working, what isn’t working, what you thought would have been true about you by now, what surprises you about what’s true about you now and much more is emotional, vulnerable and cathartic. Allow yourself the freedom to travel these roads without judgement, but instead, with observation. Think of it as taking inventory. An inventory is merely taking stock of what’s there.</p> 
<p>When I worked in retail, we had a semi-annual inventory for all locations. We would close early one night and get to counting stock. All we did was to count per SKU or per offering. We would itemize on a prescribed inventory tracking sheet and assemble them all into one binder for submission (Yes, it was paper. Yes, it was a long time ago). From there, leadership looked for both shrink issues (theft, loss) and “misses” in item selection (“we thought this product would be a hit and it wasn’t”). The evaluation and judgement came after the inventory. Do your work similarly.</p> 
<p>It would have taken all night had the inventory counters stopped every time there were too many or too little of an item. “Oh gee, why didn’t we sell more of the red version of this? I am so surprised. Seems like people loved the blue one. But the red seems more appealing to me. I wonder why. Michael, what do you think?” You see? Hours. Take the initial count and wait on the evaluation.</p> 
<p>You’ll find that understanding what your value system, fulfillment quotient and invested time allotment are set the table for healthy analysis and judgement. Crafting your vision from this build of information and evaluation ought to flow naturally.</p> 
<p>Victories of the past, where a vision was achieved, cannot be our focus forever. Celebration is wonderful and healthy (always) but staying at the party long after it ended moves us from jubilation to stagnation. It’s no longer about a lust for life but about glory days. Time to move on.</p>

The unwavering “dig-in” of sides or individuals where blockades are erected to show how much certain ideas and position matter.&nbsp; And to be fair, some of these blockades do matter. Values are real and ought to cause both protective and assertive action. The people will rise, hopefully, ready to compromise.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Every time I see the makeshift blockade from Les Miserables, I sit in awe. Random pieces of furniture – tables, chairs, bureaus – along with rugs, logs, crates and more come together as a symbol of tenacity, fortitude and commitment. Those rebellious front-runners stood on values of health and opportunity. They rose in opposition to the government that would not help secure them, and in some ways, fostered degradation. Dig in, Revolutionaries, dig in.</p>
<p>However, we cannot break desks and chairs daily in our organizational communication and dynamics efforts, at least not daily. Is everything blockade-worthy?</p>
<h3>What is Compromise?</h3>
<p>Compromise is a valuable ally, and it is one whose value has been untapped in many companies. Some organizations have labeled success in compromise when, despite initially having just one choice, three kinds of requested K-Cups are available to staff. Accommodation is not the same as compromise. According to <a href=""https://www.gottman.com/blog/manage-conflict-the-art-of-compromise/"">Gottman Institute</a> research, “Compromise never feels perfect. Everyone gains something and everyone loses something.” That’s how compromise works.</p>
<h3>Compromise in Organizations</h3>
<p>In an organizational dynamic, compromise is the right alignment of influence bartering. There are ways individuals, departments and divisions can have their needs handled by the supportive influence of other individuals, departments and divisions. The very best managers recognize that their influence is directly connected to their willingness and acceptance of others’ influence. Compromise is dependent upon how and when this influence is exercised by each and all parties connected.</p>
<p>It’s in this way that compromise is different than cooperation. Pulling together towards a common goal or affirmed value is, by practice, what good cooperation looks like. I mean, how many of those team building retreats do you have to go on to learn this one? Don’t drop this dude, link arms, bend at the knees. If the principles of compromise are applied here in addition, in order for the desired cooperation to occur, compromise in methodology, amount of effort and dismount tactic will happen. No one person may have his/her/their way met completely.</p>
<p>That’s usually the sign of immaturity in your companies. Which supervisor has a “my way or the highway” attitude? Better, which C-Suite leader has a “my way or the highway” course of repeated action? Ouch. You know it happens. The art of compromise is lost on this influential individual and in its wake a lack of trust and a lack of care settle in by those around such a leader. The question asked by that leader should not be one of “Are you going to go my way?” but rather “Which ways are value-centric rather than preferential?” There can be a canyon of difference in the answers to the latter.</p>
<h3>Directed Influence</h3>
<p>Those blockades might be ready for dismantling while some may need reinforcement. Compromise is not about weakness; it is about directed influence. The “growing up” of management is sorely lacking in some of the smallest and largest organizations today. Address it with a real roadmap which includes an understanding of what matters and how compromise fits. Teach leaders how to survey the “land” and observe the signs. Ask them, “Do you hear the people sing?”</p>

And while no judgment is being passed (ok, likely a mild form of it is but it will not appear in this blog), the choices made in the Baldino household has run the gamut. Walking into the family room might find “The West Wing” or “Jane the Virgin” or “New Girl” on full display. And while I get ready to re-watch “The Mandalorian” Season 1, there is one show that was on quite often that did surprise me – “<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0417299/?ref_=kw_li_tt"">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a>.”</p> 
<!--more--><p>Netflix offered this aminated series and, apparently, many watched. The child hero, Aang, destined to unite the various tribes and kingdoms at conflict was not quite ready to do so upon waking up from his deep freeze. While not spoiling the adventure for you, Aang spends much of his time training and developing while having adventures along the way.</p> 
<p>Often the training and development combo is thrown out there together, but most times, the distinction between the two is misunderstood. In its simplest form, training is about learning and practicing a specific skill or technique, usually to perform a task or to complete a job. Development is about more holistic growth for an individual, inclusive of a training regimen.</p> 
<p>A baseball player, for example, can train to get better at hitting. Physically, the stance can be altered, the grip can be changed, the hip motion can be addressed, all under specific repetitive training sessions. The batter will be tasked with applying these new approaches to each up at the plate, and to do so, the batter will need to practice these skill improvement recommendations. This is the heart of training – what is something new to know, something additional to get better at what I know or what I do, and something that will improve my performance.</p> 
<p>However, becoming better at batting does not make a better overall baseball player. Yes, in part, that player may get better in a specific area, but the development of the whole person as a better ball player will be found in the application of many areas of training as well as in the non-physical approach to the game. Knowing and understand the philosophy of various baseball strategies, being able to determine an opposing team’s choice of strategy, being able to predict plays and how to best play offensively and defensively are all developmental growth opportunities. Certainly, there will be training involved in the developmental process, but the rest of the growth comes through an expansion of critical thinking and viable application of relevant and timely competencies.</p> 
<p>The experiences a person has to apply the philosophical considerations and tactical trainings will forge a path to development. In a business context, there can be a shortsightedness to expect training to concurrently lead to development. It is an unrealistic expectation that can frustrate managers when they don’t see the “full return” for the training offered. Challenge the premise rather than the training, frankly. We see various anti-sexual harassment training completed by tens of thousands of employees, for example, and yet we do not have fully developed individuals putting that training into effect. Merely completing the training may not affect the outcomes desired.</p> 
<p>Aang had to train to get better at the four bending disciplines. He practiced, learned new techniques, tweaked some hand motions and watched those better than he for pointers. These areas were important, but it also took realistic job preview moments to solidify the mental and emotional components necessary for his development into the Avatar. Training, yes. Development, more yes. Yip Yip!</p>

And my first thought was, “What the heck does that mean?” (Sorry for any rough language).</p>
<!--more-->
<p>If you can think back to last year’s Super Bowl, there was a “We Believe” commercial run by Gillette. The gist of the ad was that men needed to own up to the impact of toxic masculinity accepted for centuries and to make a change. It was bold, expensive and timely. And when Gillette touted its entry as the best commercial of the Super Bowl, they were met with criticism. Was this about what Gillette believed or was it purely marketing capitalizing on the #MeToo movement? Gillette offered a “cause marketing” duality in explanation; however, they could not confirm within its own walls that toxic masculinity was a focus of cultural change.</p>
<p>Some years further back (they all blend together at this point), <a href=""https://hbr.org/2012/07/cultural-change-that-sticks"">Aetna</a> desired to change its culture by mandate. The organization made a deliberate plan to upend what their long history of “Mother Aetna” (as referred to by its own employees) had been. Leadership decided that it was time for something new and they acted upon what they wanted. Of course, the problem was no one asked the majority of cultural stakeholders. No one asked all levels of staffing what was needed in the company and how the company could better support a healthier, interactive approach to work and to community. The silliness of the exercise became apparent as quickly as it had begun.</p>
<p>Culture shifts regularly. In vibrantly productive organizations, culture is galvanized around mission, innovation and equity, whether right or wrong. There is an intention behind how the collective works together as well as how each participant works. The sum of the parts makes the whole culture.</p>
<p>So why is the verbiage around “shifting” still making the rounds?</p>
<p style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.75; text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"">Humareso helps companies of all sizes navigate their internal and <br>external diversity, equity, and inclusion strategies.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.75; text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"">{{cta('47122bae-95b3-426e-84a8-8b9b984af9e2')}}</p>
<p>In part, it’s popular. And popular does not mean effective; understand that clearly. There is hardly a business that isn’t leaning on a cultural initiative, however ineffective or disconnected it may be. Things like town halls and engagement surveys are good things, but they are a tool rather than a solution for culture. Doing popular things that can be shared on social media or on a company website is not shifting culture. It’s likely stifling culture by being more about process shifting or product development.</p>
<p>We’re working remotely more than ever. Happenstance relational moments that can be cultural shifters or cultural affirmers cannot be as random as they were. Culture is influenced by personal connections just as much, if not more so, as the organizational structure. Without a large portion of this happening in the manner it used to, it’s up to the company leadership to devise opportunities for collaboration and communication to happen in <a href=""https://portal.humareso.com/knowledge/dei"" rel=""noopener"">new ways</a>. Culture is still alive and needs tending.</p>
<p>Treating culture with care and concern, feeding it and encouraging its growth is necessary. And for many organizations, this is the shift. The shift is not merely idealistic, as in a “look, we tried” scenario; rather, it’s a movement to change that requires constant attention and consistent reinforcement. It’s not to be event-oriented; it’s supposed to be intentional. An ad on television does not make your culture shift. Your culture evolves into health through a series of intentional, small, daily influences. So, when you look to shift culture, look more into what real culture requires. Is your leadership truly ready to do all that needs to be done to build this? Is it only about behavioral change rather than organizational change? Defining culture takes work but look first at where you are today. Don’t sugarcoat. Own it, warts and all. Then work with all teams to know what’s next to do, to think. Imagine watching the Gillette ad as an employee of Gillette knowing that there was a chasm between the impression management being offered and the reality being lived each day. That’s a company failure tough to slice through. (See what I did there?)</p>

And while that was cause to celebrate, she earned this bit of history in the 13<sup>th</sup> season of <strong>The Bachelorette</strong>. It would be twelve seasons before the first Black Bachelorette was selected. Seems odd for that to have been the case, right? Recruiting biases could be the culprit.</p> 
<!--more--><p>Historically, the franchise would promote new Bachelors and Bachelorettes from the previous seasons’ contestants. And yet, therein was the rub. If we don’t have diversity from the onset, how can representation ever happen in this progression of talent?</p> 
<p>This “Like Me” phenomenon is part of the issue. Hiring (“Casting” for the TV show world) can be thrown to the current staff to help bring people in. Word-of-mouth recruiting then occurs. Current employees refer candidates, usually from a friend/acquaintance relationship. With this type of referral, employers may pass on the preliminary screening process by the linking a potential candidate to his/her friend’s reputation at work.&nbsp; And while this type of recruiting is easier and less costly, it can lead to a practice of disparate impact and recruiting biases.</p> 
<p>By having such a uniform-type of candidate/employee, the workforce would likely lean heavily towards having too many people of one race, one gender, one socioeconomic background…one “type.” This “Like Me” truth can take hold without much effort. Stop and look around at your organization (yes, you can do this virtually, too). Is there a “type” in place? And if you can’t see anything amiss, are there a couple of people you could ask to do the same surveying of the landscape? Just because you may not see recruiting biases does not mean they aren't there.</p> 
<p>While this may not be an intentional practice, as would be required to show disparate treatment, it can still be discriminatory because the results of hiring would show inequality in recruiting practices. And with the impact of social media and employee-centric sites, your organization can be called out for any and all of this. Employees are more willing to give the lowdown on what really goes on at an organization – the good, the bad and the systemic. Employer brands have been decimated by these reports, not merely by the accusation, but by the clear facts.</p> 
<p>It should have been apparent for <strong>The ABC Network</strong> (parent company – <strong>Disney</strong>) to notice that there were no visibly diverse contestants on their show, but it was not. They functioned for years. And lest you think that one leading Black contestant means the problem has been fixed, it should be noted that the first Black <a href=""https://abc.com/shows/the-bachelor"">Bachelor</a> leading contestant was announced for Season 25. Yes, 25. The twenty-four previous Bachelors fit a “type.”</p> 
<p>This work requires vigilance and honesty. So, start with the hiring practices at your company. How are we finding candidates? Do we need to be more deliberate (or deliberate, period) in sourcing for those outside of our perceived type? Likely, there are some avenues of proactivity that can be explored. Whether its internal process change or external expertise, make the additions/changes necessary. Do the work. It’s no longer okay to let things go on as they have been; actually, it never was okay.</p>

For six seasons of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downton_Abbey""><strong>Downton Abbey</strong></a>, Lady Edith struggled with her place in her family and what her future would hold. She tried to jump on any opportunity and walk through any open door with consistency. Edith struggled to find solid ground to walk on and a sense of appropriate predictability for her life. And her family, particularly her sister Mary, made it more complicated for her by providing commentary instead of help.</p> 
<!--more--><p>Underestimating uncertainty is not a wise decision. As managers and supervisors, be smart about how you engage with your team. Let’s lay the groundwork first. This is not a call to be a therapist. The mental health struggles faced by so many across the globe, heightened by the pandemic, are not to be addressed frivolously. Yes, it’s good to ask how someone is doing, really doing. It’s good to foster an environment of transparency, respect and healthy communication. These are right and good standards in the workplace. But don’t confuse that with professional resources for mental health.</p> 
<p>According to a recent study from Gartner, employee misconduct rises as much as 33% in the workplace during times of uncertainty. Think about that. That’s 1/3 of your staff that engage in some level of misconduct at work. To be clear, let’s not think we’re talking about felony crime (although, it’s included). Don’t expect to see computers and desk chairs being brought out the back door into a white box truck to be sold on Craigslist (ok, that was a little too specific and likely an indicting characterization). Most of what happens in misconduct is communicative – sharing company secrets/property with outsiders, engaging in harassment/physical conflict with teammates, stealing time (lateness, early outs) and the like.</p> 
<p>It’s in these areas that managers and supervisors should have direct impact. Cultivating an environment for workplace psychological safety means upholding company values. And truly, these are the times where values need to be active rather than idyllic. Are we acting as an organization with integrity? Embracing collaboration? Fostering innovation?</p> 
<p>One healthy approach is to sit (virtually, of course) with other managers and walk through the organization’s values. Ask the hard questions of one another regarding the application of these values within departmental procedures and communications. Decide on a uniform approach to such matters. A united, consistent front will aide in providing certainty in an uncertain world. Staff will appreciate knowing how work works.</p> 
<p>Be encouraged, too, that consistency does not mean complacency. If that’s been your experience, you’re doing it all wrong. Consistency fosters comfort, true, but that environment should include comfort in creativity. Consistency in an application towards innovation, for instance, doesn’t diminish creativity but rather envelopes it in safety and in a smart approach to risk. As a management team, tweak (or maybe overhaul) how employee contribution works and how it’s fostered. A tool for psychological safety is consistent application. Embrace it here.</p> 
<p>Of course, be thoughtful about your organization’s EAP or your local city/county service offerings for those staff in need of more. Work with human resources to bring those individuals the resources needed. The CDC has a page of resources and links in light of COVID19 and its impact on the mental state of people (<a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/stress-coping/index.html"">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/stress-coping/index.html</a>); none of it needs to be kept in the dark, but it does need to be handleEdithd by professionals. Use these resources.</p> 
<p>The way in which certainty can open the door for possibilities is when hope appears. As managers and people leaders, think of yourself as a Hope-Bringer. You do not need to have all the answers but the willingness to consistently bring resources to bear and to base decisions on the known values of the organization. Even Edith found consistency in the end. There is hope.</p>

While I would never be the strongest on the street, I could be the smartest of the bunch. Thankfully, my competition for that title was limited. It didn’t mean that I would do others’ homework or let them cheat off me; instead, I used my smarts to become good friends with the strongest in my grade and in the grade above me. I was smart enough to know that these relationships would serve me well and used collaboration to do it.</p> 
<!--more--><p>So, when the movie, <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081207/""><strong>My Bodyguard</strong></a>, came out in 1980, I felt that I should have been paid royalties. I had done this. <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0538485/?ref_=tt_cl_t1"">Chris Makepeace</a> played Clifford, a new kid on the block who was easy pickings for Moody, played by <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000369/?ref_=tt_cl_t3"">Matt Dillon</a>. Clifford is smart enough to hire Linderman (Adam Baldwin), the toughest kid in the school, to be his bodyguard. In the end, what Clifford needed is what Linderman needed – friendship. They wound up working together rather than one working for the other.</p> 
<p>Isn’t that what life’s really to be like? Think about work, where you spend oodles of time (I have been wanting to use “oodles” for months) with a team of people, whether remote or in person. These people become your crew. And the healthiest crews know how to best leverage the strengths of the individuals to the benefit of the whole. Collaborative plans are made for projects to be completed in a way that utilizes time well based upon these individual skill sets. If we’re smart, this is how it should be.</p> 
<p>However, there are areas of competencies that lie untapped due to a lack of exposure. Clifford would not have known how strong he was until he put himself in certain situations. The experiential learning environment is an overlooked commodity of many organizations. We believe “we can’t” much more so than “we can.” To combat this, a safe environment for experimentation and trial with a team of people focused on similar objectives should be fostered.</p> 
<p>The dreaded pilot program comes to mind for some of you. Yes, I know. Frightening experience for some of you, but don’t let a bad roll ruin it all. A pilot program allows for such experimentation and can change the approach to future problems. When we have a stake in it, we hold it tighter and want to see whatever it is succeed. By having such a setting in place, these untapped or underdeveloped competencies can emerge. We see this even in training. Experientially formed training curriculum has a higher rate of retention and application than those out-of-the-box programs that do not involve team decisions in the content. We ought not underestimate how deeply this trail can take an organization.</p> 
<p>Start small and enter a dialogue with your crew around collaborative work. How has our collaboration been? Is it effective? How might we engage differently to get better results? Ask your team and get ideas to consider. When you ideate, there is no commitment to any one idea, but it will expose interests, points of view, values and preferences. In the spirit of understanding and inclusion, having a forum for free expression has led to some significant positive movements and changes in organizations. The experience of collaboration gets wider and more innovative once this environment is fostered.</p> 
<p>When you sit in front of your next Teams/Zoom/Skype call, ask about this. Start (or reactivate) the process of collaboration and experimentation. There’s no Bodyguard to pay to find out what others want, need or have to offer. Take advantage of the free option!</p>

Long before the genre of Reality TV (especially scripted reality…I mean, really?) was affirmed, we looked for the underdog in such shows. These people had studied and practiced for this chance. We wanted their preparation to help them win. Preparation is a necessary winning ingredient for each of us as we stand at the door of post-COVID times.</p> 
<!--more--><p>What we’re experiencing now forces us to either get prepared or to seek out help to do so. I have been overwhelmed at the number of responses from our last blog regarding dealing with denial. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmT1-hYko&amp;t=3s"">Dolvett Quince</a> and I offered a three-part webcast, too. It has resonated with so many of you. And it brings me back to pre-COVID 2020 (if we can remember such a time) when I shared that resilience was going to be the marker for this year, and for post-COVID as well. Little did I know how much so.</p> 
<p>Many of you are leading teams. Those teams need to skill up when it comes to resilience. You are an example of how to handle life circumstances, beyond just work, for better or for worse. The application of a process that works will influence thinking, not just yours, but those around you. It will bleed into work, yes, but into so many other areas, too. It’s not a burden, truly, but it does require preparation.</p> 
<p>So what are your preparation methods for post-COVID? If we’re going to stop denying the circumstances in front of us and forge a new path of acceptance, a plan is needed. Doing so haphazardly instead will likely lead to failure and discouragement, opening the door to retreat to denial once again. Equip yourself with what is needed for success. Let’s look to a friend from the 90’s, Montell Jordan, to know how we do it.</p> 
<ul> 
 <li><strong><em>Reach for my 40 and I turn it up</em></strong> – Check your environment. With having to work from home for so many, are you still in reactive mode with your setup? It was understandable in March and April to have a make-shift work area, but now that there may be more permanence, establish a dedicated space, even if only a 2 x 2 area. Using a common table for kids to do school work, a significant other doing work and you doing your work on one kitchen table is tough. Maybe do a bit more of a rotation on space. Can it be mixed up a bit? Maybe do two hour shifts between a comfy chair, the dining room table, your front porch, etc. And what things are not working in your environment? If the TV remote is a temptation for you, then ask someone to hide it or make it harder for you to get to it. Address all environmental considerations – space, noise, function, airflow, connection.</li> 
 <li><strong><em>Designated driver takes the keys to my truck</em></strong> – We need accountability. There needs to be at least one person who knows you and with whom you can be honest. Moving out of denial and out of bad habits takes honesty with someone. If you have more than one, great, but find at least one person who will have your back. Schedule a regular time for such conversation. Don’t assume that because your significant other, for instance, is there with you daily that you’ll naturally have such talks. Be deliberate about the time and the topic. Carve it out with specificity.</li> 
 <li><strong><em>Hit the shore ‘cause I’m faded</em></strong> – With just as much deliberateness, set aside time to not work (that doesn’t mean you have to fall down drunk! re: faded). Part of the reason the denial of what work life and personal life have become is because we keep our heads down for longer portions of the day. Many companies are finding that their staff are actually working longer hours at home due to the ease of access. Starting at 8 AM rather than 9, even casually, and then maybe shutting down around 6 PM while having had a working lunch makes for a long day, and even less desire to think once finished. Binge watching in the evenings keeps our day full of distraction and busyness. Find a place and time to center on something else and change the scenery. Maybe it’s the shore, mountains, a bike ride through the park, whatever. Your mental preparedness depends upon clear thinking. You’ll be more innovative by carving out such time.</li> 
 <li><strong><em>Tip up your cup</em></strong> – Celebrate the small victories in addressing your circumstances. Once you get out of the “come post-COVID, we’ll get back to normal” mindset, and you begin your planning for what is real now and to come, set aside time to evaluate your progress and celebrate the smallest of wins. If you’ve gotten better at parts of your schedule, great! If you’ve made strides in your accountability with another, awesome! Recognize your wins.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>These principles are valid, not just for post-COVID life, but for most circumstances we have to face. Our deliberate attention and planning are needed. Things won’t get better by just wishing they would. Today is the day to do it. “Throw your hands up and let me hear the party say: This is how we do it.”</p>

If you’re not familiar with “<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043014/"">Sunset Boulevard</a>” then put it on your watch list. Before it was a hit <a href=""https://www.andrewlloydwebber.com/show/sunset-boulevard/"">Broadway musical</a> (thank you, Glenn Close), it was a 1950 film gem. Gloria Swanson played the role of Norma in a beautifully neurotic and disconnected way. Pure gold.</p> 
<!--more--><p>Norma swore that the public was waiting for her to return to the screen; they were not. Denial is the bitterest pill for some to stop taking. The hatred of its reality doesn’t stop people from taking it. It’s a bit of the devil you know is better than the devil you don’t. And when you mix it with a “hope springs eternal” mindset, you can swim in denial for years, decades.</p> 
<p>As Cher put it: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x-fkSYDtUY"">Snap out of it</a></p> 
<p>Start with self. The depth of your denial does not have to be deep, but merely present. You tell others to advance in how we do things while you grip tightly those corrective action forms you love. You hold meetings telling others we must embrace technology to be relevant in the business world today while you still struggle to get Zoom to work and put no time into getting better with it. You ask those around you to uphold the corporate values through online social interaction while you haven’t engaged online with anyone so as to not upturn the apple cart. These are only a few of the effects of denial. Physician, heal thyself (apparently this blog is going to be full of anecdotal one-liners).</p> 
<p>As business-minded people, we must change. Not only the how but the why. Our relevance impacts not only the business bottom-line but our own marketability. I know that the higher percentage of surveyed people say they like or embrace change, but it’s a <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/markmurphy/2016/08/14/the-big-reason-why-some-people-are-terrified-of-change-while-others-love-it/#30cd75732f63"">lie</a>. We remain more comfortable with what we know more than we’d like to admit. And that’s where denial takes a silent hold.</p> 
<p>Further, those around us adapt to our denial quicker than we may notice. The effects of denial can leave one feeling boxed in static expectations. And we rise to that reality through our comfort.</p> 
<p>Reinvention and recalibration are change management tools. You control the narrative more than you might be comfortable with or aware of. My friend, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/dolvett/"">Dolvett Quince</a>, is a former “Biggest Loser” celebrity trainer. When his time on the show was over, his career was not, despite the professional constraints others may have placed on him. He is not “just” a trainer. He is a nutritionist, a motivational coach, an author, and an entrepreneur. He is not a one-trick pony. It is hard to fight against those who want you to stay in the one lane they know, but it is vital to your professional success. Dolvett chose to move forward in all the ways he excels. Similarly, you must rise.</p> 
<p>Face the circumstances in front of you with determination and acceptance. When an organization decides it’s done with you, that does not define you. It happened, it’s over and it’s a door of opportunity that awaits you next. That reality is there for you; choose it. If a relationship that you’ve invested years in ends, face it. While it’s not who you are, it is part of your story. Dwelling keeps you from changing. Rise above it by focusing on all of who you are and what you can do and you'll find yourself overcoming the effects of denial.</p> 
<p>We all have stories. Denying their impact would be foolish but remaining in their grip is devastating. Get up, get help to get up, and get moving. You are more than your circumstances and your failures. They’ve shaped you, but it’s not the end. Bring your other skills to bear and start the next chapter. Tell Mr. DeMille, you’re ready for your close up.</p>

You see, I am 50 years old today. It’s odd to type that. I very much feel anywhere from 15 to 24. I have the same swagger, the same vibrancy, the same hunger as I did then. I still believe in what could be more than I believe all is lost. I think it unlikely that I will live another 50 years, so I want to write what I know now.</p> 
<!--more--><p>I know love. I know more than how to receive it, but how to give it away. I have learned through the years that I need to love without expecting the return. If it comes, great. If it does not, then I was offering a conditional love. Loving someone else isn’t supposed to be connected to what they can give me. Rather, love is about sacrifice. I understand that love shouldn’t be wasted on someone who doesn’t want me. I love because I choose to love. By choosing love, I offer the very best of me which is actually a gift returned right back to me.</p> 
<p>And because of that perspective on love, I am grateful for all I have been given. I know that thankfulness enriches my spirit and maintains a grounded humility in me. There is much in my life that I am grateful for; at times, it brings me to my knees. While I know that the business built in <a href=""https://humareso.com/"">Humareso</a> has been a tremendous gift for me and many others, I cannot be more humbled than I am when I look at my three children. These young adults bring tears to my eyes almost daily. These three would be anyone’s dream legacy. How could I not be thankful?</p> 
<p>I know that there are gifts I have, but I know better the ways in which I am to use them.&nbsp; The thousands of people who’ve heard me share messages on organizational strength, inclusion and equity, human resources management, talent acquisition and cultural integrity humble me. I know that I find a home when I share truth, when I encourage large change or an incremental shift in perspective, and when I say a word that frees a burden carried in secret. My words have power, no different than anyone else. I know that I have a duty with those words, and I have grown wiser in my approach.</p> 
<p>I know that people are different but the same. Our differences may be protected by law, but that does not necessarily lead to a changed heart. I know that I have been fortunate to know many from other countries, other backgrounds and other perspectives. So much of what I have learned through the years has been directly influenced by the variety of people in my life. They’ve included me, rebuked me and loved me when I needed to have my butt kicked. I know diversity is more than a number or just about representation. I know that equity matters and must be fostered and fought for. I know that my voice has an impact.</p> 
<p>I know the power of forgiveness. I believe that many people are acutely aware of their need to be free. I know, from years of hearing from employees at all levels in an organization, that the fundamental need to know they’re okay is life changing. When mistakes happen (whether they seem a big deal or not), people long to be told it’s okay, or if not, how they can move towards making it right. And while time may be the only cure, I know that I can join them on the journey of waiting. And when forgiveness is offered, a life may be restored. Heavy words but I have seen the power of it.</p> 
<p>And finally, I know that kindness wins. From a guy whose been known to be a jerk at times, I know better today that kindness has opened more doors, has connected me to more people and has brought me into situations that I would not have entered were it not for maintaining a positive approach. I will keep working on this one, but I know the power of kindness better than I did even 10 years ago.</p> 
<p>This is a different kind of blog for me to share. Thanks for your indulgence. 100 years is probably not in my future. But what I know is that if today were my last day, I know so much more goodness and love than I did before. And that will be enough for me to take into eternity.</p>

A stance I’ve heard in a professional setting for almost 30 years. It’s come out of the mouths of managers, line-level employees, senior leadership, as well as my own mouth.</p> 
<!--more--><p>Fairness is a difficult concept. It’s often heavily influenced by an individual perspective of what is right, equitable and just in a particular situation rather than necessarily what is generally needed. For instance, when we hear of someone’s home being broken into by a drug-influenced burglar, and the homeowner is awakened and shoots the intruder, the response may be one of “Damn right!” However, if the drug-influenced burglar is your child who is struggling with addiction, the personal verdict is likely to change. You would be influenced by the personal connection to the killed burglar. It’s no longer about a general response but one of heartbreaking consideration for the plight of the individual struggling.</p> 
<p>So, how do you handle situational responses from individuals?</p> 
<ul> 
 <li><strong>Listen</strong> – it’s wisest to hear the person out, not repeatedly, but at least once fully through. This listening should be active – ask clarity questions, ask next level questions, ask for examples.</li> 
 <li><strong>Repeat</strong> – once you have a handle on what has been shared, repeat some of what you heard back to the individual. There are times that merely repeating the struggle as presented opens the eyes of the person. There are times, too, where what was shared is offensive. It can be more difficult to hear said back to you when you have to affirm what you said. For instance, “You shared that ‘they seem to be getting everything.’ The ‘they’ you were referring to was Black people, correct?”</li> 
 <li><strong>Dissect</strong> – get to the real issue with the individual. “You shared that you’re upset that Maggie has requested to use her vacation time when you wanted to. You’ve, also, shared some details as to Maggie’s incompetence in her role. Is the issue that Maggie shouldn’t have her job or that you wish you had requested your vacation time sooner than Maggie?” And when the defensiveness sets in, if it does, be sure to dissect further. “Let me ask this: if you had requested your vacation sooner than Maggie, would you be coming to me to discuss your perception of Maggie’s incompetence?” The heart of the matter is in there somewhere. Again, use the words offered by the individual back to the person, in this instance, in question form.</li> 
 <li><strong>Resolve</strong> – it’s okay to disappoint the individual. Every struggle is not going to be met with a homerun response followed by a euphoric reaction. That’s not reality. The goal is resolution. Here’s what I heard you share -&gt; here’s where there seems to be confusion -&gt; here’s what the issue seems to be -&gt; here’s what can be done about it (even if just one option). And above all, don’t let the issue linger. Deal with it as quickly as possible once the struggle is shared.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>And lest we forget, these moments are also teaching moments, particularly in the arena of bias. All kinds of scary and subversive bias will creep out. Do not let that go. Repeat it back and challenge it. It’s not okay for a sense of fairness to be code for “I’m better, that type of person isn’t worthy or that group of people already gets enough.” It’s about systemically fighting against bias that is unjust, disregards equity and, ultimately, is discrimination.</p> 
<p>Fair is not what we can consistently expect, even on our best days. However, the framework for fairness may be flawed so much that it’s difficult for many to know the difference. If you have corporate values that speak to transparency, collaboration, inclusion and justice, then take the time to define what that means to the organization. Without context, you’re asking each person to define those terms based upon what seems fair and right to the individual. That’s going to cause more issues. Address it, set the tone and then respond to the individuals who struggle with applying those values fairly.</p>

<p>“When the pandemic hit (and it’s still happening to some extent), people longed for normalcy and a return to the life and patterns of what we’d been accustomed to doing. Now, the civil unrest, protests and call for social justice has moved us in a new direction emphasizing that we should not return to how things ‘have been.’ People are frustrated, angry, anxious and uncertain as to what lies ahead for our society and for each of us personally.”</p>

Most days found me outside playing ball in the street, running from place to place, and ending many summer nights playing “<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kick_the_can"">Kick the Can</a>.” I could run. Track seemed to make the most sense for me. The cardio was there, but the upper body muscle development was lacking. I struggled with pullups. As I hung there on the bar trying to will myself upward, I remember one of my coaches saying it’s okay and asked me to hop down. Immediately, the guys on the team started teasing and laughing. To be honest, I likely would have done the same. Later, that same coach said, “Listen, John, here’s how we’re going to get you stronger.” And he, along with another coach, came up with a plan to help me catch up with the muscular development needed to make me a better runner as well as an overall stronger person.</p> 
<!--more--><p>The horror of the George Floyd and <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/article/breonna-taylor-police.html"">Breonna Taylor</a> murders, as well as others, in the recent weeks has shown the world how far from developed we are as a people. And while the many years of diversity training, racial awareness programs and in-school education have impacted a good portion of the population, the systems have not caught up. We have individuals trying to make a new path in a system that convinces itself of its validity daily. When I think about equity, this problem comes to mind often.</p> 
<p>It is not enough to applaud our diversity and inclusion efforts as if that were an arrival point. Those areas are components of an overall culture of belonging and equity that every company, agency and system should reflect. When I was weaker than my teammates, it would not have been enough to let me on the team and tell me to run. I would not catch up. Certainly, I would run faster/longer, but I would remain behind those who started at a physical advantage over me. Their opportunity, access and encouragement differed from mine. And while my freshman year track team experience is not meant to equal in context the racial and socioeconomic disparity in our world, the example is meant to offer a simplistic frame of reference to build schema.</p> 
<p>In our human resources world, specifically, we still have work to do. Of course, our organizations need us to forge new or expanded paths for hiring, promotion, learning management and skill development, but we may need to start at home. Within our own HR sphere, how do we expect those systemically kept out to be allowed in if we’re not deliberate? I was shown an opportunity for someone to write for a conference, but only if the person met criteria that would systematically keep those who’ve not had the opportunity to do so in the past held back. It’s the dilemma of requiring experience but not allowing an experience for a person. Haven’t we pushed against that in job postings and job requirements for years? Why would we allow it within our own discipline, even if only a conference? We are still part of the problem.</p> 
<p>Equity means leveling the playing field. Equity means providing additional resources to those who are starting at a disadvantage. It’s the call of Black Lives Matter. No one is saying that other lives don’t matter; we’re saying that black lives need our attention, our support, our resources, our protection in ways that we don’t need to offer, for instance, to white lives who already have access. And when we in HR don’t act in a manner to do so, we are the problem. Don’t point to your “racist” CEO, your “privileged” CFO. Point to you. Our own conferences, career ladders and affinity groups are fraught with systemic truths that are non-equity minded. They require examination and change.</p> 
<p>As a former varsity track athlete, I can tell you that the decision to invest in people who have a lack or disadvantage is not charity; it is love. Love is a decision that changes futures. It positively alters access to possibilities, to opportunities and to purpose. This kind of love is something we are all capable of; no previous experience is necessary.</p>

In many ways, it has been the primary distraction during the COVID-19 pandemic. Whether it’s dance challenges, pranking family members or celebrity peeks into their lives, the platform has garnered millions of views and thousands of new accounts. Some of my favorites are the cool videos of golf trick shots, obstacle courses and house-covering domino setups. The patience it takes, for instance, to setup dominos across bedrooms, down the stairs, through kitchens and living rooms, and ending with a splash in the backyard pool is remarkable. I struggle to be patient getting <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/comments/eoampd/fire_tv_stick_isnt_loading_disney_plus/"">Disney+ to work on my Amazon Fire Stick</a> (I digress with tension in my fingers). But the celebration experienced by those who set up such a course when it all works is invigorating. Their efforts worked out and there is joy!</p> 
<!--more--><p>With many business owners and senior leadership, the effort to set up the dominoes for a return to work plan is taking up much of their time. Care and consideration are generally being applied to the course, understanding that as one domino (an initial step in the plan) falls, the next will engage. For some leaders, this represents the first time in quite a while where such deliberate care is placed. That is not necessarily meant as an indictment, but rather a reality. The process of work prior to the current health situation may have been very go-go-go, not leaving much time for care at the level desired.</p> 
<p>It is, also, showing some leaders that they are out of practice. Being able to partner with business owners and senior leaders as they dive into planning, often creating and sharing those plans with me ahead of launch, has led to some deep conversations and corporate soul-searching. Some of these plans have shown themselves to be caring in consideration but not careful of the big picture. Picture, if you will, a dominoes path setup in a circle about six feet in diameter. Yes, those dominoes may have been setup with care and consideration, but they are not very wide in scope or representative of more than just one room, if we’re using the TikTok example.</p> 
<p>The knee-jerk consideration is about getting back to doing the work. That’s a right thought. How will we get work done moving forward? What changes, if any, will have to be made? What will that do to the output of service or product that we produce? These questions, and ones connected to them, have to do with getting work done. But, we do need to remember that in the room next door is employee relations. Think about how the dominoes from how work will get done connect to how those doing the work will feel, maintain safety and potentially respond to the work process. This is not only about the “feels” of getting work done, but the requirements of safety, both mentally and physically, of getting that work done.</p> 
<p>From there, the dominoes will need to travel into the physical office setup and telecommuting, scheduling, performance management, employment branding and corporate marketing, talent acquisition…and the list goes on. It’s a big house in which we have to set these dominoes up. The mini-circle of dominoes in one room might feel for a quick minute that we’ve done something, but its lasting effect may be over as soon as it began.</p> 
<p>Perhaps assigning each member of senior leadership and those key personnel one “room” of responsibility to come back with so that another person can bridge the transition dominoes connecting each room would be helpful. We need many eyes on how our return to work plan should function – for compliance, for fit, for function and for success.</p> 
<p>If you set this up well, it might make for a cool internal TikTok video. And yes, you can dance, too.</p>

Repeatedly, the questions","2020-05-06 04:00:00","2022-05-26T21:12:13.785Z","<p>The plight of transparency for businesses during the COVID19 pandemic has taken on a difficult trajectory for some organizations. Repeatedly, the questions surrounding how much information to share get asked and the advice varies from open the gates to hold onto as much as possible. The answer lives somewhere in the middle.</p> 
<!--more--><p>A favorite fear is that of gossip and rumor. People crave information and when they don’t get it, they fill in the blanks. Business owners, directors and managers have had experience dealing with this type of workplace distraction in the past, and, as with most of these experiences, are now overly cautious about sharing anything. Fool me once…</p> 
<p>However, post-COVID19, the impact of many of these business decisions and strategies may hit employees differently. We are not talking about vapid water cooler conversation, but rather, financial and professional stability. These employees are dependent upon their compensation to support families, to pay for housing &amp; schooling, to put food on the table, to keep bills paid on time, etc. It is about the basics of living. The struggle is not about who is gossiping about whom, but rather, it is about how will I function and live.</p> 
<p>Employees need to know, also, how health and safety will be handled upon a return to the workplace. <em>Now hear this:</em> No workplace will be germ-free. The <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/return-to-work.html"">CDC</a> and <a href=""https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/"">OSHA</a> are not mandating that companies free their environment from every virus and sickness-producing microbe. Of course, there are suggested guidelines (with some state mandated regulations) to minimize their infection. Businesses will be adopting new procedures as a result and these need to be shared with employees. They want to know what is being planned.</p> 
<p>And on top of this, you can actually use this time of information sharing to open a door for input. Introducing (or worse, maintaining) an atmosphere of “do what we say regardless of what your concerns may be” is not in keeping with many of your posted company values let alone reflective of the type of productive culture desired. It is okay to ask staff what they think about workplace safety, timelines, production and conditions. This is not an open-ended call for every idea to be enacted. That is impossible, so set the expectations regarding gathering opinions and desires.</p> 
<p>I got to be involved with an employee who is requesting a personal bathroom be installed at the workplace. She shared with the company owner that she would not be able to return to work unless she had her own private bathroom. She acknowledged that the company had already issued return to work directions regarding the employee bathrooms. The company shared that there would be cleaning supplies and directions to wipe things down before and after personal usage. The employee appreciated these efforts but said she would feel more comfortable if they would build a separate bathroom for her. This is not likely a reasonable accommodation nor is it reflective of the majority of feedback you will get in asking the question.</p> 
<p>Too many managers step back from inclusive collaboration due to the likes of the extreme example mentioned. Be thoughtfully transparent with what you know and what you think will be done while leaving room for comments and questions. Your staff may come up with a brilliant idea; it is more than possible, I promise. When we work together, the environment is ours, not theirs. That is the best foundation for a return to work strategy.</p> 
<p>Lastly, for all employees, remember that this is new territory for everyone. Your managers and business leaders/owners were not given a playbook on “Pandemics and Business Function” at any point in their career. They are most likely doing the best they can. If you have suggestions or concerns, look to enter conversation graciously. It may be an easy slide to an accusatory tone when it comes to protecting health and safety. Instead, be deliberate about ensuring a collaborative tone, free from blame, to determine a path for action and for compliance, where required. We keep hearing that “together, we are better.” It’s true.</p> 
<p>And when any of you hear a co-worker start a conversation using, “Well, I heard…,” stop that person. Challenge where they heard it. You will want your efforts to be based upon fact. And even then, you will want to take those facts back to the source in a way that invites conversation, not consternation.</p> 
<p>Ultimately, we must remember and show that we have each other’s best interests at heart and in mind. The return to work strategies are for all, not for some. Thinking broadly will help both managers and staff approach transparent collaboration thoughtfully. We need to encourage such critical thinking. Our workplaces need us to do so.</p>

First, not everyone who is working from home is working from home in the classic sense. Those who are caring for COVID19-related relatives as well as those trying to be homeschool teachers (most for the first time) are not telecommuting in the way the future of work might require. Your kids are not going to stay home forever (please God, no); some states are already preparing for a return before the school year is over. And once that happens and those ill relatives move beyond this health crisis, your staff may be able to telecommute in a more traditional sense.</p> 
<p>Secondly, not all of those who clamored to work from home want to keep doing so. For sure, there may be a mix of remote and onsite work, but it may not be exclusively one way or the other. Meeting work objectives is still the goal, right? Where that gets done is going to require a different approach or two.</p> 
<p>And thirdly, the manner with which we complete work is evolving. Managing people merely by being physical near them will no longer be enough. Supervisors may no longer be able to rely on subjective sensibilities to determine acceptable performance for the organization. The remote workforce needs to have more substantial resources for output excellence as well as for management performance review. We may not be sure how to handle this fully today, but we need to get ready, quickly.</p> 
<p>Certainly, all of this will be mixed with a renewed sense of safety and health considerations. Our world of work will be more – more considerate, more flexible and more aware. Surroundings will be seen with a new set of eyes. Our processes will need a refreshed sense of meeting objectives. And our employee relations will need a deeper approach to individual learning and corporate success. It won’t be a nice-to-have; it looks to be a necessity.</p> 
<p>Are you getting ready?</p>

His music served to lift up those in trouble or despair. He looked at the human connection and penned lyrics and music to capture moments in time and the needs faced. His music will continue to live on)</em></p> 
<!--more--><p>With the “stay at home” and quarantine mandates in place across the US currently, the doors have opened wide for social media living. Celebrities and the average Joe/Joanne are posting more, streaming differently, taking favorite food polls and playing the ISpy camera game. Filling the time with some sort of connection lent itself very easily to social media.</p> 
<p>And while the thousands of books regarding introverts and extroverts tell varying tales of interaction and meaning, as people, we long for some sort of connection. That connection doesn’t have to be in the dozens (or hundreds) as some extroverts might enjoy; it can absolutely be in just one or two close relationships. FaceTime, Zoom, etc. have helped to foster such connection. Virtual happy hours have been the rage over the last couple of weeks, with tons of posts showing how elated people seem to be with the techno-boozing.</p> 
<p>And yet, the unintentional distance that may be produced through these engagements is real. Portraying happiness and stability might be the current norm in social media posting. Being vulnerable enough to “cry in your beer” while having a happy hour would seem out of place and a downer on the rest of the team/group. The fear of being too real is itself real.</p> 
<p>Even in the social agreement that this time is hard, there is a perceived decorum to how we should be offering and expressing our feelings. If someone is not able to be authentic in the manner with which we’ve socially decided behavior and responsiveness should be, then that person runs the risk of moving into a deeper sense of isolation, insecurity and possible depression. The virtual social norms in place judge the participants. Have those norms taken place in your online social group efforts?</p> 
<p>Be sensitive to those in the “room.” Who is participating? Is the room safe to share? Are we intentional about authentic connection or is it just to say we’ve connected? Not every physically distant social interaction has to lend itself to a forum for gut-wrenching engagement but be sure there are some. You need to connect at that level; others may need to connect with you at that level. Foster an opportunity for a depth of connection, at least in part, during the week. It’s very easy to lose someone because of the feigned expectation of stability.</p> 
<p>Check in with purpose. Look, it’s cool that you’ve baked a pie from scratch or made a <a href=""https://www.dancespirit.com/7-best-tiktok-dance-challenges-2645577794.html?rebelltitem=3#rebelltitem3"">TikTok video</a> with 1,000 views in 24 hours. That’s all good (well, maybe). However, we need to ask, “How are you doing?” The most basic of questions, yes, but ask it with the most caring of inflection and intention. Ask to know not merely to say you’ve asked it. This time is a mental strain for many as much as anything else. Your ability to connect is a tool to combat that strain.</p> 
<p>Keep hanging in there. Rally with at least one person with whom you can share how you are really handing things. You may need to do so through video, but do it nonetheless. We all need it and we all need to offer a safe place to do so.</p>

As a few have stated, “Today has been a long month.” Humareso has had to pivot like so many of you. Our entire team is working from home focused on supporting you and your teams. For some of you, you’ve had to close your doors due to mandates. For some, you’ve had to reduce the workforce due to decreased or non-existent business. Whether you are a B2C or a B2B business, you’ve been impacted.</p> 
<!--more--><p>I know you’ve been looking to various governmental agencies for direction and assistance. What those systems are used to doing in weeks is being asked to be done in days, and at times, overnight. We’re seeing that they cannot move quite that quickly. Even with the legislation passed, the dissemination of that information and the process to be used are still unclear.&nbsp; Add to it the new federal stimulus package and we’re seeing even more confusion.&nbsp; All of this is to say, please keep your eye on those legal reporting outlets and your own legal counsel. Bits and pieces delivered through various news outlets and Facebook posts may not give the full picture. Many of the nations’ law firms are hosting free webinars to walk through how all of these components are to work. We encourage you to listen in.</p> 
<p>For instance, our friends at <a href=""https://www.fisherbroyles.com/"">Fisher Broyles</a> have put together an overview, up to last night, of the state and local Stay At Home orders, along with some helpful federal and state links. It’s a very useful resource and the link is below.</p> 
<p>We know that some of our distribution and big box retailer partners are hiring as quickly as they can. They are seeing an overnight increase in demand for stock workers and online customer service representatives. But, we, also, know that others of you are in choppy waters with some of you holding on for dear life. Honestly, we at Humareso wish we had the ability to steady those ships. For now, we’re committed to supporting you in all of the ways we can – compliance, off-boarding, hiring, organizational strategy…or even, just to talk things out. Whatever we can do, please know we’re here.</p> 
<p>We’ll continue to deliver information as quickly as we can using our various forums – email, LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook – as long as it is delivered from governmental and legal outlets.</p>

My comprehension was a bit slow, compounded by the slowness at which I read. Nevertheless, I enjoyed reading and I was able to do so very early in my life, but I would have to re-read things to ensure understanding often. The stress of reading for class and then being tested on it forced me to take my time while not taking my time (figure that one out!). However, when I was able to read for pleasure, the doors opened for comprehension. My enjoyment was not encumbered by assessment stress. One of my early favorites was Judy Blume.</p> 
<!--more--><p>When I read “Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing” in Fourth Grade, I found a new author to devour. I read Beverly Cleary along with anything regarding Greek mythology but Judy was different. It’s like she knew what it meant to be in my head. Friends would talk about how funny she was in her writing but for me, I knew she just understood my vantage point.</p> 
<p>A friend read “<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Are_You_There_God%3F_It%27s_Me,_Margaret."">Are You There, God? It’s Me, Margaret</a>” and she told me that she cried. She cried because Judy helped her to know she was okay. This friend was so uncertain in herself – her place, her gifts, her friends and fitting in – that the relief from this book was palpable. It helped this friend come out of her shell a bit and become encouraging to her peers. When she shared this view with me I realized that it was the same for me. Judy spoke to my uncertainty.</p> 
<p>The world is full of uncertainty. As much as we feign “woke-ness,” we struggle to be who we think we are or who we want to be. We look to others for assurance, our bank accounts for security and our work for esteem. When there are cracks in the foundation, our uncertainty comes crashing in. Consider a pandemic like COVID-19 and you may find a whole new level of stress and anxiety due to these unchartered waters. The uncertainty can be stifling.</p> 
<p>Dealing with this uncertainty requires a moment. More specifically, taking a moment. Sit back and center. This might include some light meditation and controlled breathing. This moment might include a refocus on the commitments made or a focus on ones to be made. This moment might be to identify those mental distractors and call them out for what they are. This moment might be to express some emotion and then to respond to the release with the next step to take (no wallowing).</p> 
<p>And like Margaret, find friends. Find a few who feel as you do or who can appreciate how/why you feel as you do. Share, laugh, emote, encourage and spur. Your ability to equip is internal and external. Uncertainty will always be a real consideration, but it has power for only as much as we give it. There is no way of knowing how this Coronavirus pandemic will turn out, but we can take action to minimize its impact on us and our sphere of influence. We <em>should</em> do that. Take the moment, center and act; partner with others.</p> 
<p>Herein is the opportunity to then help others. Those employees, family members, friends and teammates are struggling to a degree. Be the Margaret they need. Rally the troops and face the uncertainty together. Solutions will appear and you will know where you’re going.</p>

An iconic character pulled through the generations into different environments and timelines, all the while maintaining his aloof, impatient air. He knows what he wants and acts upon it. Benedict Cumberbatch’s recent version settles into this characterization deeply as he works to solve various crimes. Sherlock is determined to move forward based on whatever thinking is driving him. The perennial dog with a bone. He does not necessarily care about the feelings of others as he does so; his insensitivity is viewed as a character strength (at least in his eyes).</p> 
<!--more--><p>For those of us in management, human resources and leadership roles, we don’t have the luxury of being so insensitive and impatient. In fact, a general theme of sensitivity is upon us. With the frenzy over the Coronavirus (COVID-19), our workplaces are narrowing down on policies and procedures once again. And for good reason. Are we able to be flexible in letting people work from home? If the work cannot be done remotely, is there a contingency plan to keep illness at bay and not infect the office, the warehouse, any facility? Do our policies speak to that?</p> 
<p>I have always been fascinated by those who specialize in business continuity. It’s one of those fields that most ignore until it’s needed and usually by then, it’s too late. Some business owners find themselves pinching pennies today but risking dollar bills tomorrow without instituting such continuity plans. It’s short-sighted and risky but it’s not an unusual response.</p> 
<p>As people, we do defer to the “no, not me” perspective. We look at various ills, dangers and crises as things that happen to others, but not to ourselves. For example, on the road, nearly 90% of drivers believe they’re a better-then-average driver. They think they can handle whatever comes their way on the road. And yet, there are 6 million car accidents annually just in the United States each year. The odds of being involved in an accident are larger than most may assume.</p> 
<p>This optimism bias settles into personal, business and relational realities for all of us. Now, of course, it’s best to look at the glass as half-full. Contingency plans are in place to keep that optimism in effect. They are not usually designed to move the organization forward, rather to keep the organization where it is, even at its basic levels. An optimism bias might keep us from putting such plans into place.</p> 
<p>It’s very similar to a will. It sounds like a good idea. We understand why we should have one. We agree that a list of last wishes may not hold up in probate court so having an attorney, or some other legal mechanism involved, is better. And yet, the most recent surveys from <a href=""https://www.aarp.org/money/investing/info-2017/half-of-adults-do-not-have-wills.html"">AARP</a> and <a href=""https://news.gallup.com/poll/191651/majority-not.aspx"">Gallup</a> show that somewhere near 60% of American adults do not have a will. We remain optimistic, not that we won’t die, but that we have time to prepare. The same holds true for businesses.</p> 
<p>Organizations need to look at their systems, production and people to determine the types of employee contingency plans and maintenance operational strategies to put into place in the event of a large scale event – power loss, health epidemic, weather catastrophe or other huge emergency.&nbsp; Don’t wait.</p>

When people of poor self-consideration are challenged to think deeper about the contributions made through their efforts, the responses can run from self-actualization to awkwardness. On the latter end of the spectrum, those exposed to their own impact might find it uncomfortable to hear it, see it and feel it. They may not have been encouraged in their own worth, more than just in work, but perhaps throughout life. Your kindness in sharing a right perspective may not be received so comfortably initially.</p> 
<!--more--><p>Remember that we don’t know the full story of everyone who comes into our lives. Asking, “what’s wrong with you?” in an attempt to get that person to think more confidently will likely work counter-productively. It may deepen their negative thoughts about self because the inability to see their worth is another example of their inability to do things well. The dichotomy here is real and it is a difficult one for the individual to overcome. As a cheerleader or praise-giver, your job is to continue in kindness and in small encouragements to chip away at that false narrative playing in their minds.</p> 
<p>On the other end of the spectrum is the person who finally sees it. The actualization of contribution, worth and esteem hit like a warm gulf wave. It’s engulfing but not debilitating. “I matter” takes on a new meaning, if not a first meaning. Value is not only ascribed, but it is believed. To be sure, this is not an overnight realization for that person. Time has been spent to lay a new foundation.</p> 
<p>Impactful recognition might be the breakthrough members of your team need. It may be that your decision to consistently point out healthy contribution and extra effort will make the difference for someone who isn’t used to hearing this, but who now realizes that there’s a new perspective to consider. As managers and leaders, how skilled are you at this type of consistency in recognition?</p> 
<p>Too often, we see intentional recognition happening annually upon review. This isn’t enough to change the mindsets of those who struggle with personal impact and contribution. Consistent messaging given throughout the year seems obvious, but there are two issues with it:</p> 
<p style=""padding-left: 40px"">1 – Most managers don’t do it</p> 
<p style=""padding-left: 40px"">2 – Most managers don’t really know how to do it</p> 
<p>If a manager takes the buddy-approach (“C’mon, you’re great. You have to see that. Don’t you see that? Why don’t you see that?”), even with the best of intentions, it can slide into a perceived indictment for the hearer as to another area of inability. Train managers on how to affirm and ask exploratory non-judgmental questions. For instance, “What a wonderful job you did on the Smith project. Your ability to use time effectively was key to this success. How did you learn to apply it so well?” Give the hearer the opportunity to share performance process rather than personal perspective. Those lines may overlap in the explanation, but that employee won’t dwell on it, if even notice.</p> 
<p>If a manager takes the this-is-your-issue approach (“It’s really hard to compliment you. You don’t receive it well. I can’t keep telling you you’ve done a good job if you don’t believe me”), then you’ll keep that truth alive. The hearer won’t be open to moving forward in confidence and may begin to show a gap in performance soon. Fear of being noticed may settle in as a result of the received rebuke.</p> 
<p>Truth be told, many struggle to take affirmation and recognition for a job well done. It’s not just one person’s problem. What we can do as leaders is help supervisors and managers. We do it by teaching them how to offer appreciation, how to respond to an “undeserving” team member and how to build confidence in the one as well as the many.</p>

What I found most striking was how right each person was. Who could speak louder, with more words, with more passion, by including non-relevant information and by reminding others of how great the sharer is, was the common tactic. Lots of bluster and very little consideration as to why the change might be happening. The commentary, however, was rich, I must say.</p> 
<!--more--><p>When you watch, if you do, <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5396394/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1""><u>American Housewife</u></a>, you’ll be struck by how many opinions the main character, Katie, has. She is eager to share her thoughts with her husband, her three children, her two closest “friends” as well as those protagonists that she struggles against in Suburbia. And while there are a few moments of laughing aloud, the audience mostly sees a predictable pattern of assumption, opinion and personal realization over the course of 30 minutes. The show is not terrible as it plays upon a reality with which we can identify – repeated patterns and change avoidance.</p> 
<p>Change is going to come. Yes, as trite as that may be, it’s coming. You don’t have to ask for it, although you may. You don’t always get a vote. You don’t always have to like those who bring the change or for whom the change affects. You don’t have to agree. You don’t have to like it, period. But change will be making a visit.</p> 
<p>What we can put our attention towards is how we respond to the change. Have you read the online treatises by people unhappy with a particular change? Facebook posts littered with frustration are easy to put online, but how often do they lead to a better understanding of the change? Even if some people provide a new perspective to the change, we hunker down with those who respond similarly to how we’ve posted. The comfort is in “think like me.” Unfortunately, that strategy will not work in change management.</p> 
<p>We all get the “I need to vent” mentality, but too often, we act as if processing change stops at this point. It’s okay to have a few to vent to, but the direction of change management is decision-laden rather than response-oriented. In what may be the bleakest view, Charles Kettering said: “The world hates change, yet it is the only thing that has brought progress.” While there may be debate as to the absoluteness of that statement, it cannot be denied that change and being changed have affected our upward trajectory as a people.</p> 
<p>Change allows us to wrestle with the why. Why have we done something like this for so long? Why has it worked? Why has it not? And the ultimate, why am I willing to die on the vine to defend this? To be clear, there are times to fight, but we need to know why. Wrestle with it. And when we can see that our reasoning is based upon fear, esteem, position or the need to be right, we should be willing to move beyond that and into managing the change that has to come.</p> 
<p>It’s easy to resist change, in some ways. Just dig your heels in and hold your breath. If you pass out, the change will happen without your participation. You’ll awaken stunned, mad and resolute on fighting. Those are all emotions you control for yourself. The mark of the professional is to approach the need for change by evaluating its potential benefits and shortcomings, testing theories, applying solutions accordingly and measuring results. That takes effort and willingness, and that is what matters more than mere commentary.</p>

We started our kids early with <u>CandyLand</u>, <u>Guess Who</u>, <u>Chutes &amp; Ladders</u> and <u>Trouble</u>, moved up to <u>Life</u>, <u>Clue</u> and <u>Monopoly</u>, and now see them playing <u>Ticket to Ride</u>, <u>Qwirkle</u> and other variations of the board game genre. Games were regularly part of my growing up. Usually, however, these games involved playing cards. I learned <u>Pokeno</u>, but also, 500 Rummy, Blackjack and 7-Card Stud as a kid (my great uncle taught me to shoot dice, but that’s another story…). One game that didn’t make its way into my house was <u>Mystery Date</u>. I have a younger sister, but she had no desire for this game.</p> 
<!--more--><p>I remember being over a friend’s house where about 6 of us wound up playing this game as a joke when we were teenagers. It was hilarious at the time. It’s a game based upon stereotypes and caricatures. You didn’t want to get the date with a nerd; you wanted the quarterback. Absurd.</p> 
<p>Recently, I had the chance to speak with some folks about candidate personas. The feeling seemed to creep into the “Open the door for the Mystery Date” vibe.&nbsp; For context, let’s use the precise definition that my friends at <strong><a href=""https://beamery.com/blog/create-a-candidate-persona"">Beamery</a></strong> offer for candidate persona:</p> 
<blockquote>
 <p>“A candidate persona is a semi-fictional representation of your ideal candidate. This persona is formed by defining the characteristics, skills and traits that make up your perfect hire. Creating personas help guide your hiring process and help you identify the talent that is the best fit for your organisation.”</p>
</blockquote> 
<p>For some, this may seem like a road to discrimination, and honestly, it may be. For many hiring managers, they want to replace or add a person to the team who is just like so and so. To be sure, there may be valid reasons why a candidate like so and so would be wonderful. But are those reasons more than skills and aptitudes? When you picture the person, is the person white? Male? Fit? Standing? As subtle as it may be, that imagery may keep bias as a systemic piece of the puzzle in the talent acquisition process. Is it deliberate? Not necessarily, but that won’t make it any less true or damaging.</p> 
<p>This is not meant to be damning of the right usage of candidate personas. The concept of persona is a fixture of sales and marketing. It’s the answer to the “who is our audience” question. The qualifications of that candidate are valuable as products, services and messaging are delivered. To whom do we want to get to? The same question is valid for the roles we’re looking to fill. Where are those people who possess the competencies this role needs?</p> 
<p>An appropriate starting point is with those employees currently demonstrating the knowledge, skills and abilities in work. Ask those employees about the possessed traits which have led to success and healthy performance. Use those responses to help define the persona for a candidate to be successful. Do not go into the gathering of information with a preconceived notion of what the result will be; that will skew the result and be a product of bias.</p> 
<p>If you have hiring managers who ask an interview question regarding the reason for application to this company, the candidates themselves will introduce an aspect of clarity to the candidate persona. And add to the mix the hiring managers themselves, and you should have enough material to sketch out the competencies of a successful candidate.</p> 
<p>When Gavroche in <u>Les Misérables</u> sings “Little People,” the audience is reminded of the ways in which his character has value, contributes to success and performs smartly. Yet, Gavroche is not what you might expect in a valued contributor. He doesn’t appear to be ready. It’s a truth for all of us. The external is not what defines success. Our ideal candidates do not need to look a certain way, but rather, be given the forum to succeed by application of the skills possessed, the knowledge learned and the attitude to contribute healthily. It’s time to sell <u>Mystery Date</u> on <strong>eBay</strong> and get it out of the workplace.</p>

We endeavor to make resolutions stick and changes in behavior permanent. In January, the gym is more crowded, fast food restaurants see a dip in sales and infomercials run aplenty.</p> 
<!--more--><p>Particularly, in matters of giving something up, like smoking, drinking alcohol, carbs, etc., this reflective time of year makes you believe you can. Denying yourself something or someone may be the right next step in your health or growth plan. You may have identified an unhealthy relationship that needs to go. Perhaps you’re done arguing with your body over gluten. Perhaps you began saying no to environments that bring you down or encourage poor choices. Good for you!</p> 
<p>The pitfall is the gap left behind. Typically, the “what I once did” time needs to be met with more than merely repetitive denial phrases. “I don’t want a cigarette, I don’t want a cigarette, I don’t want a cigarette” is a defensive posture, and the repetition of such a denial merely draws your attention back onto the thing you’re trying to move beyond. It’s a manic cycle and often leads to a break in resolve. You can’t just fill your mind with what you want to avoid.</p> 
<p>This is a mental exercise as much as it may be anything else. Think about a similar tactic with managers. When a manager is being encouraged to move beyond some poor managerial habits, the success quotient for that is increased exponentially by replacing those unfavorable tendencies with those to emulate. Too often, our corrective action and coaching opportunities with management is punitive, particularly for those at first level roles. We don’t need to exert our power by merely disciplining someone. We are to help equip and encourage better. Offer other specific options to the manager. Ask the manager to try a particular tactic and then report back to you as to how it went.</p> 
<p>The application is the same for your goals: to remove unhealth from your life. Look to equip and encourage. Equip yourself with new thinking by changing habits. Replace more than just denial. If you’re quitting smoking, take up something else. Be active in a different way so that you’re not just dwelling on what not to do; change your routine to change your mindset.</p> 
<p>People management comes with change management. It’s unavoidable. For those in human resources and in leadership positions, learning how to manage change is a skill to learn and to refine. Just because you’re supervising others does not mean you’ve been anointed with some kind of innate knowledge of handling changes in process, habit and function. “Just do it” may work for Nike, but it’s not a real strategy for affecting long-term change. How many diets have you been on? Workout commitments? Promises to read more? To spend more time with family? Fill in the blanks with the start/stop changes we’ve tried to implement through the years.</p> 
<p>Replace what you’re denying with something affirming. If you want to get healthier, then replace something in your schedule for an hour of working out. Perhaps you can replace the environment to achieve a similar goal. If you normally watch television at night, maybe you can walk on a treadmill while you watch. Replace the couch with the treadmill, so to speak.</p> 
<p>The application of replacement thinking at home, at work, socially, etc., is manageable when done proactively. Set a plan at the onset of the denial desire. What will I do to change how I deal with “x”? Know that denying yourself is not an ideal strategy. Yes, for a select few, willpower might be enough. For the vast majority, it is not.</p> 
<p>So, forget you, bad eating choices, poor communication habits and unfruitful financial decisions. A change is coming.</p>

Top songs, books, movies are revealed. Those top influencers in entertainment, politics, economics, and even, human resources are named. It’s a warm blanket to a handful (those making a list) and a blistering reminder to others as to how they don’t yet have a voice, an audience or a forum. It can be devastating. Quite reminiscent of high school, to be honest.</p> 
<!--more--><p>I was obsessed with <u>Square Pegs</u>, alas, for its only season. This early 80’s teenage sitcom was everything I needed it to be. It was about fitting in and not fitting in. It was about pretense and authenticity. It was about status and esteem. Sarah Jessica Parker led this show for a brief moment in time, and it felt like a window into my life. Flash forward a number of years and it’s easy for all of us to get right back to our high school freshman year.</p> 
<p>Our worth is often based upon things that don’t get at the core of who we are. Our work, for instance, shouldn’t define us, but rather be an expression of us. What are the constructs like at your workplace? Are teams built up to only be valued for end product, or is there room for assessing the process? There are times in our innovative history in this country where inventors have failed, repeatedly. There are times that the success others have experienced are based upon the work offered by others who did not see their dreams actualized. And often, those previous “heroes” did not make a list, garner an award or be seen as a subject matter expert.</p> 
<p>Your ability to encourage a valued approach to worth is mindset shift that many managers need help exploring with their teams. And while there does have to be an output quotient that meets goals and objectives, we have learned that the psychology of being valued for such output only stifles innovation and creativity. <a href=""https://www.fastcompany.com/90325414/ithe-relationship-between-creativity-and-productivity"">Fast Company</a> did work this year on such a consideration. Psychologist Scott Barry Kaufman acknowledges, through his research, that “today’s workplace isn’t always set up to encourage optimal creativity, and that we should learn to redefine ‘productivity’ when it comes to the creative process because it’s not going to look the same as getting things done.”</p> 
<p>We’ve been in those meetings where it’s only about getting things done and not setup to foster creative approach to solving problems or to predict what we should be ready for next. One of the challenges in high school was that we had to acclimate to the same mode of behavior – change clothes for gym, move like cattle to get to class by the bell, wear certain clothing, participate in sports and activities within a certain allotted time frame, etc. – and when we perform similarly at work, we can revert.</p> 
<p>Our goal should be to move people forward.</p> 
<p>When status based upon fit and performance are all that matter, the lists become stifling. I am not talking about published lists, but the ones we know exist. Perhaps senior leadership or managers keeps in their minds. We see where we fall short. We are reminded that we’re not one of the 50 most beautiful people or one of the valued few. What does that do to the department’s creativity? What does that do to motivation?</p> 
<p>Remember that once you “arrive,” the game changes to staying on the list. The original reasons for recognition may be replaced by the pressure to be good enough moving forward. It’s part of the pattern as to why sophomore albums do poorly. The pressure isn’t to remain true to the process of creation found in the first record, but rather, to remain relevant and to sell albums.</p> 
<p>Check the lists, spoken and unspoken, in your organization. Are they achieving what they were intended for? Motivating or crushing? Rallying people together or silo producing? High school is over, but it’s effects can last a lifetime. Avoid giving those effects an opportunity to live large.</p>

As a kid, I remember going with my Dad or Mom to the Colonial Theatre to watch whatever was playing. In 1983, my Aunt would drove me over the river into New Jersey to watch <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086567/""><u>War Games</u></a>. It’s a classic. It’s was the Next Gen AI flick. Matthew Broderick (David) was the player for “Joshua” (the computer). If you’ve not seen it, I can’t ruin it. But as David plays the game, things start to feel too authentic. David asks Joshua, “Is this real or is it a game?” Joshua responds, “What’s the difference?”</p> 
<!--more--><p>This time of year, I can’t help but see those seeking after the perfect holiday. It’s good to be thankful. It’s good to cook food. It’s good to recognize how special people are to you. But, it’s also good to feel good about yourself.&nbsp; Sometimes, the pursuit of so many other things pushes us towards unrealistic perfection rather than simply enjoying the moments. The stress and strain can become almost unbearable for some.</p> 
<p>Social media can escalate those feelings. Those posts about family, friends, food, even those about gratitude, can be hard to swallow. They may serve as a reminder of what once was and feels like never will be again. They may serve as a reminder of what never has been. And for those posting, perhaps seeking validation through likes and shares is meant to soothe some open wound or just-below-the-surface misery that these six weeks can bring. It’s easy to portray a reality online but that won’t help the real reality that you have to live. Coping on both sides of this 21<sup>st</sup> Century social media landscape is challenging, but you are not alone.</p> 
<p>So what can we do to help others?</p> 
<ul> 
 <li><strong>Check in on people</strong> – ask how people are and wait for a real answer. If you know that this holiday season is the first without a particular loved one then you know it’s a transitional year. Stay connected with those people.</li> 
 <li><strong>Invite people</strong> – if you can, ask others to join you. Look to those who might seem on the fringe. Who is standing off on the sidelines? Maybe a simple ask to join you for coffee is appropriate. Maybe asking the person to join a small group headed out to lunch. Small invitations can be helpful, even if the person declines.</li> 
 <li><strong>Think sensitively</strong> – while you may want to be a ray of sunshine, it might be a bit too much or over the top. Easy does it. Read the situation and respond appropriately. Be mindful of language that is forceful or commanding. You want to ask and offer, not tell and expect. Engage with the person but keep an eye on how things are being received. Adjust accordingly.</li> 
 <li><strong>Be resource ready</strong> – if someone shares more than what might be a seasonal blah, and the conversation moves into some heavy stuff, do you have resources to share? Think about your company’s Employee Assistance Plan, if you have one, or know what services your company can access. You’re not a counselor so it’s wise not to act like one. Be friendly, be thoughtful, but don’t be therapeutic. And if someone shares suicidal thoughts or preparation, get help. Don’t wait.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Check with your human resources department to see how to best be ready to tackle the discontentedness, sadness and/or stifling perfection-itis that this season may evoke in others. You can’t solve for all these realities but you can know how to react or to help.</p> 
<p>And for those of you struggling, you are not alone. Talk to someone today. Contact the <strong>National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255)</strong> if you need support. Your life is valuable. You have worth. The holidays do not define you. Do what it takes to heal. Like General Beringer says in <u>War Games</u>, “Well hell, I'd piss on a spark plug if I thought it would do any good!”</p>

HR peeps at HR Tech in Vegas. My peeps. Different, opinionated, passionate, vivacious people. My peeps. We encourage each other. We challenge each other. My peeps.</p> 
<!--more--><p>It got me thinking about the conversations I’m having with other peeps, many of whom lead organizations. More and more companies are talking about inclusion and equity. It’s refreshing. The power of people individually regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender, veteran status, and the list goes on, is a more consistent topic of discussion. And then how these individuals come together for the good of the whole. The conversation has been good, very good even. So, how’s the action?</p> 
<p>As a statistics aficionado, I often review the latest metrics and seek to understand context. For instance, research from <a href=""https://www.bcg.com/en-us/publications/2018/how-diverse-leadership-teams-boost-innovation.aspx"">The Boston Consulting Group</a> tells us that companies with a more diverse workplace earn 19% higher revenue than those not diverse. Cool. But what does diverse mean?&nbsp; Is it merely numerical? What we know from research, too, is that much of the diversity accolades are based upon how many people groups are added and represented.</p> 
<p>Representation is not inclusion. And inclusion is not equity. And without working this progression, fostering an individual’s sense of belonging won’t happen. These are heavy lift considerations and come with a cost. If you are part of senior leadership and have found that your meetings consist of sighs of relief upon review of the latest talent acquisition diversity numbers, you are missing it. Stop patting yourself on the back.</p> 
<p>But let’s back up a minute. When the push for diversity began, why did it begin? Needing better revenue numbers and then applying the statistic on diverse organizations mentioned above weaponizes diversity. Companies may tout a push for diversity but do so with ulterior motives. Those motives will surface quickly and the turnover numbers (at around 6 months) will show how effective the “diversity” initiative really is. When you choose to pursue diversity, you are supposed to be choosing to change the fabric of the organization, not merely make more money. Those organizations that show such revenue growth are few because of the fundamental understanding that diversity is not the goal. It’s equity.</p> 
<p>Companies implementing a few pieces to such an equity-driven initiative show themselves to be most successful. For instance, how do you handle getting a lay of the land? Often, companies forget to audit in areas such as inclusion and equity. The diversity numbers make it easy to push out a report, but these other considerations require a heavier lift with more subjective and open-ended questions. A simple 10-question survey with radio button answers won’t cut it. Yes, horror of horrors, it will require more effort. But true inclusion and equity efforts are people-centric.</p> 
<p>Listen to your people. All your people. It’s okay to explain that listening to everyone does not mean that all requests can be implemented. What it does mean is that all will be considered. All will have an opportunity for influence, innovation and impact. That’s what we all want anyway. Talk less, listen more. Solutions can then be implemented.</p> 
<p>The audit might be uncomfortable, but it is absolutely necessary. Taking stock of what is really happening here at our organization allows for real transparency (not the displayed “company value” of transparency) and the chance for real opportunity to heal, to grow and to encourage.</p> 
<p>There may be some lessons to learn from Thompson Reuters <a href=""https://www.refinitiv.com/content/dam/marketing/en_us/documents/reports/diversity-and-inclusion-top-100-companies.pdf"">Top 100 Most Diverse and Inclusive Organizations</a>, but not all those lessons will work for your company. The audit will lead to diagnosis and then to treatment plans. Involve a team of people in to do the work. It should be people from different departments, from different socio-economic backgrounds and educational pedigrees, from different people groups. The explosion of creativity within this group will require a champion or two to foster. Lean into those folks. Equip them to lead effectively and bravely.</p> 
<p>To end with one more stat, 67% of job seekers are looking for diversity in their next organization, according to a <a href=""https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/blog/diversity/"">Glassdoor</a> survey. And these job seekers represent various people groups. We need to engage with these talented individuals, but we also have to cultivate our companies to be inclusive and equity-driven. Today. We are to look to this today. Today, please. It matters. Today.</p>

But imagine living in the airport. Of course, there are delays long enough to bring this possibility into fearful reality. However, for Tom Hanks in <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0362227/?ref_=nv_sr_2?ref_=nv_sr_2""><u>The Terminal</u></a>, it was all too real. Without giving it all away (stream this movie!), language and communication move front and center in this film about separation, tragedy, love and humor. Viktor (Hanks) has us follow him through this journey, exposing us to the perspectives of others along the way.</p> 
<!--more--><p>Communication is pivotal for success at any organization. Nothing new here, but what kind of communication is where things get tricky. In a recent chat, an employee shared that she couldn’t understand why people didn’t respond like she did. She understood that “everyone is different but come on.” She couldn’t understand the differences in social norms and in what she termed “basic respect.” What does it mean to be different in this context?</p> 
<p>Two areas of concern and consideration present themselves: Bias and Expectation. When we deal with others who are not like us, by heritage, socioeconomic, educational or geographic considerations, we are confronted with a varied approach to values and their application. Those who were raised in the same neighborhood, with similar experiences, money, family constructs, etc. will likely be easier to work with because of an obvious understanding. Clearly, our world does not operate in such a small nucleus any longer. We are working with people from different backgrounds. To maintain a negative view of these folks due to their “not getting it,” may be a disturbingly deep bias with which to contend.</p> 
<p>And lest you think line-level staff are the only ones who may struggle here, fear not. This type of bias crosses job roles and position. Are those who are promoted, paid more, etc., more like those in charge of making those decisions? Look at it. While it might not rise to the “ist” language (racist, sexist and the like), this bias should not remain unconscious. Bring it to the light and converse about how it ever took a hold. Familiarity can be just as divisive as it can be comforting.</p> 
<p>Know the audience you’re speaking to, as best as you can. Find out what communication styles will work for each person.&nbsp; Who prefers written rather than verbal communication? Who prefers situational examples rather than a purely definitional approach?&nbsp; Look at personalities. Understand trigger points as presented. For all staff, it’s wiser to work to be heard and to be received well than to just get the message out. How can this be received in the best way? Set up the communication for success.</p> 
<p>Conversation can open the door to understanding and expectation. Alignment around expectations can lay the groundwork for a relational foundation based on trust and grace. We are more apt to give someone the benefit of the doubt if there are some relational deposits made. The “Listen to Me” approach is not something that most people find inviting if not mixed with reciprocity. Our viewpoint can be solid, but it does not need to be exclusive. We can engage in dialogue to understand and to appreciate another view.</p> 
<p>Healthy communication is not about someone winning, but rather, it’s about each having a voice. Do decisions have to be made? Absolutely, but if the process is setup as a win/loss then no one wins long-term. We have undone trust and replaced it with fear, frustration and a lack of involvement.</p> 
<p>Instead, look to make clear all points, collaborate effectively, make decisions as a result and work through the plan for follow up (expectations). By addressing bias, particularly in the first part of this process, we can better connect through our differences rather than in spite of our differences. Embrace them and lead the charge on their application. Growing out of our bias in communication, both in receptivity and in offering, will allow a progressive and effective path to be forged. And all of it can happen without sleeping in the airport.</p>

I don’t mean to be, but in our world of smartphone, public telephone calls, it’s hard to ignore.&nbsp; And when you’re in a bar or restaurant, forget about it. Some people lose their sense of decorum and become the loudest talkers. Recently, a couple were enjoying the fireplace area at Panera. The husband was working on a crossword puzzle while his wife was playing some game on her phone. He was stumped on a clue and turned to his sweetheart.</p> 
<!--more--><p>“Who was that Mexican woman who played guitar in the 80’s?” he asked.</p> 
<p>“Mexican?” his wife answered. “Do you mean Charo? She was in the 70’s.”</p> 
<p>“No,” he replied. “You know, she was the one who did that cuchi-cuchi thing. And she played guitar.”</p> 
<p>“Cuchi-cuchi was only done by Charo. She was a classically trained guitarist. That’s the answer.” She responded.</p> 
<p>“I don’t think that’s the answer,” he said softly.</p> 
<p>“It is. You don’t know her name because your mother would say her name wrong all of the time,” she retorted. “Her name is Charo. Does it fit in the squares? C-H-A-R-O.”</p> 
<p>“Yes, it fits,” he answered.</p> 
<p>“Then write it,” she quipped.</p> 
<p>Honestly, it took so much willpower not to burst out laughing at this scene. I love these two people and they have no idea.</p> 
<p>After attending the HR Technology Conference last week, I returned fresh with thoughts around the conference themes of engagement, machine learning and talent experience. How can work be made better by using these resources and pushing forward? Excellence in communication, from visualizing to planning through implementation, is needed. Charting a course for what the work to be done is, why it needs to be done and how we’ll know we’re doing it right falls to various members of leadership at any organization. This team must have a standard by which they communicate amongst themselves as well as to the teams managed.</p> 
<p>Often, organizations find themselves repeating positions and plans, restating expectations and adding meetings to recalibrate at each step. And while some may argue that these realities ensure effective communication, it might just be that the opposite is occurring. When people need to be told over and over, it can cause some relational and positional residue. On the relational side, staff can receive overdone communication as lack of trust. Constant check-ins become burdensome and de-energize teams. Completing tasks for the bigger picture become replaced by only doing the bare minimum since it’s going to be micromanaged anyway. “If my manager doesn’t trust me, then I am not going to connect steps that I can see. Instead, I will wait to be told.”</p> 
<p>Positionally, frustrations can set in regarding those in managerial or leadership roles. Succession planning conversations that consist of staff sharing, “Why would I want to move up in the organization? I can’t treat people the way we’re treated. I don’t babysit” (or some such) let us know that we’re not communicating effectively, but rather transactionally. If we relegate our roles to merely telling people what to do (see Charo above), then we’ll either have non-critical thinking staff or frustrated staff. Neither are ideal. We minimize the excellence we’re looking for and, often, violate one or more of our advertised corporate values (collaboration, teamwork, innovation, etc.). There is nothing effective in communication for our teams when we have mostly created positional toll gates.</p> 
<p>Adding technology to “help” is not going to be the answer if the mode and manner of effective communication isn’t handled first. If anything, adding technology to poor communication will only exasperate that reality. The tech, also, becomes a distraction to the real problem. We blame software that “doesn’t work” or “isn’t doing what we want” rather than identifying our planning shortcomings, influenced by our poor communication.</p> 
<p>Ultimately, we don’t want to have to be the person who tells our teams, “Does it fit? Just write it.” We want to inspire our teams to travel a path of discovery with our encouragement and skillful direction. Model the behavior we want to see, especially in communication.</p> 
<p>I didn’t have the heart to interrupt that couple to let them know that Charo was Spanish, not Mexican. I think he was having his fill of communication from his wife. Cuchi-cuchi!</p>

Some individuals run hard after it. It may be the finest compliment that a person can offer to another. Greatness is the stuff of legends and heroes. Enter HR.</p> 
<!--more--><p>With our focus on company culture and, therefore, the intensity around finding the right corporate fit (“fit” is a whole other discussion – insert eyeroll) in our talent, we look for Wonder Woman to walk in the door at every interview.&nbsp; The nuances of people development, even in our enlightened current environment, are underappreciated by management, if not senior leadership. Hurry, fill, promote/replace, hurry, fill, promote/replace. Developing talent is not a transactionally-based hope; it is an intentional push and plan.</p> 
<p>For some HR pros, they look a bit like Mickey Goldmill from <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075148/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1""><u>Rocky</u></a>. There is a gritted determination to push those in his charge to greatness.&nbsp; Mickey pushed Rocky to get out of his own head, to see what more there could be, and most practically, how to get there.&nbsp; Mickey took his experiences – good and bad – and crafted a training plan for Rocky.&nbsp; His passion and determination, however uncaring they appeared at times, were focused on the betterment of his trainee. Mickey was committed.</p> 
<p>This posture has its downside. Rocky would lament, at moments, regarding Mickey’s curmudgeon approach to life. Mickey would allow his stubbornness to affect his ability to see other options and opinions. He may not have swayed from his duties as Trainer and Manager, but he would have taught Rocky as to why those other options and opinions would not work. Rocky would know better how to think more critically and how to be able to handle future occurrences and distractions.</p> 
<p>For some HR pros, they take a more Karamo path. On <a href=""https://www.netflix.com/title/80160037?source=35""><u>Queer Eye</u></a>, Karamo is the effective pep talker. He is attentive to and a student of his client, and he crafts necessary messaging back to that person. Karamo has been known to cause a client or two to weep as a result of his good questions and thoughtful responses. He is a believer in the greatness within each person he deals with, and he won’t be swayed.</p> 
<p>Expectedly, this position has a downside as well. Tears don’t necessarily mean change or acceptance. Having a moment with a manager may be nothing more than just a moment. The experience itself is not going to affect lasting change and growth for the majority of people. It’s a good memory and a cool experience, but the accountability and the measured effectiveness aren’t there. We have all seen health regimens, diets and makeovers that don’t last. In HR, this is often seen in group training and checkbox learning management. There is no lasting effect for many.</p> 
<p>Encouraging greatness is a daily commitment. It may have better days than others, but it’s still day by day. As HR, crafting and planning opportunities for development is an ongoing responsibility. Putting the “You Can Do It” Cat poster up on the breakroom wall is not a developmental exercise. Just because someone tells me that I can be great at something does not mean I will. Not everyone is meant to manage, to tune up a car, to cut hair, to draw blood, to start a company, let alone do any of these with greatness. Pithy messages might do more harm than good in these instances.</p> 
<p>How are you developing people? How are you working with others who need to develop their people? If this is new for you, start with the last coaching chats or performance appraisals. Where are there themes in a department, if not the company? It is, also, a good idea to ask those in need of development about where they see shortcomings or about desired areas of growth. Just know that if you ask them, you’re going to have do something as part of the response (darn!).</p> 
<p>Everyone has greatness in them. That’s not trite or idealistic. It does, however, require assessment and opportunity to figure out where that greatness will take hold. Sometimes a person thinks that a particular path is where greatness will be found. You may need to be the voice of encouragement towards a different path, one where they have demonstrated skills and passion. That person may not see it yet but opening the door for exploration and attempt is what HR can do, for the benefit of the person as well as for the company.</p> 
<p>Just because I think I am the greatest karaoke singer out there does not mean it’s true. Maybe my greatness should be directed in other areas. I belt out the songs, but do I do it in the right key? A greatness question for the ages.</p>

Tennessee Williams’ play about a young couple living modestly in New Orleans when the wife’s sister arrives in need and in poor condition.</p> 
<!--more--><p>Stanley, the husband, is rough, unkind, cruel and criminal.&nbsp; He is the toxic element in the play, though on the surface, we’re to think it of Blanche (the sister).&nbsp; It’s masterfully written and perfectly acted in the 1951 film.&nbsp; Toxicity is brought to a new level as the lasting impact is subtly but beautifully highlighted in the fade out on Stella (the wife).</p> 
<p>We have Stanleys at work.&nbsp; Perhaps the criminality isn’t there (I hope!), but certainly the toxicity is present.&nbsp; There are those who thrive on rumor, judgement and being a malcontent to all.&nbsp; It’s a stress that can run deep in a department, if not the whole company.&nbsp; And for those who are victimized by these people, it’s debilitating, even devastating.&nbsp; Your contribution is impacted as your ability to engage is hampered by fear and frustration.&nbsp; And it’s time to address it.</p> 
<ul> 
 <li><strong>Assess the situation</strong>: Take the time to evaluate the reality, emotionality and depth of circumstances. While it’s true that some may be overly emotional by nature, it is not a blanket catch-all to dismiss someone’s experience.&nbsp; Look at what’s happening. What is someone doing to be overbearing, demeaning or dismissive?&nbsp; Are there specific instances that you have been a part of?&nbsp; Make note of them.&nbsp; And if you have a peer or friend to talk through these details with, do so.&nbsp; You might need to hear the point of view from someone not connected to the situation.</li> 
 <li><strong>Talk to management/HR</strong>: Unfortunately, this is often where things go awry. There may be a fear of speaking to management because of repercussion or retaliation.&nbsp; If there’s a sense of distrust, employees will more often just bite the bullet regarding the toxicity in the workplace.&nbsp; They will try to carry on and just tell themselves to not care as much or to avoid deep engagement with their work.&nbsp; And if management is the issue, HR has to be the place to go. If you’ve not spoken to HR before, try not to make assumptions about what they may do.&nbsp; HR is meant to be an outlet for workplace distress and its relevant solution.&nbsp; However, when HR and management are unsafe, then the environment itself is corrupt.&nbsp; You should not stay.&nbsp; You don’t deserve to stay embedded in toxicity with a company that minimizes its people.</li> 
 <li><strong>Document</strong>: Keep a log of what you’ve experienced. It’s valuable to the process.&nbsp; It is, also, a tool for your mental health.&nbsp; Dwelling on unhealthy thoughts is destructive, and it will only be so to you.&nbsp; If you’re already suffering with a toxic co-worker, then to have your mind saturated with it leaves you with no respite.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>It’s important to note that not every annoying co-worker is toxic.&nbsp; A toxic person is purposeful and calculated.&nbsp; There are reasons for their actions.&nbsp; The plan is to maintain position, appearance, necessity, status and/or power.&nbsp; It’s a corrosive experience to be with that person.&nbsp; Annoying and toxic are not the same thing.</p> 
<p>Be sure that frustration over process or policy isn’t being ascribed to an individual and therefore making that person appear to be toxic.&nbsp; It’s always good to look at the history of engagement with the co-worker.&nbsp; There should be a few tell-tale signs and examples.</p> 
<p>Toxic-dealing is not on anyone’s job description (well, maybe, a counselor or psychologist). If your work experience is being hampered by a Stanley, it’s time to address it. And if that toxic person yells for you to stay in line, don’t be a Stella.</p>

<!--more--><p>The cruel logic of Thanos is frighteningly coherent.&nbsp; It’s flawed and devoid of heart, but he sees it as mercy.&nbsp; Ultimately, he realizes a very important truth:</p> 
<p>“I thought by eliminating half of life, the other half would thrive, but you have shown me... that's impossible. As long as there are those that remember what was, there will always be those, that are unable to accept what can be. They will resist.”</p> 
<p>The memory of what was will be a beacon calling to those who remain.&nbsp; They won’t rest until what was lost is returned.&nbsp; The Avengers assemble one last time (or is it?) to fight for restoration.&nbsp; And while you may want to tout the plot holes and unanswered questions from the movie, ultimately, the passion lies in fighting to make things as they once were, which is enough for an audience to buy.</p> 
<p>Thanos is an HR Director.&nbsp; Harsh?&nbsp; Think about it.&nbsp; He attempts to change a perspective, an approach, a reality for many people.&nbsp; He only rallies those around him who think like he does.&nbsp; He is immovable in his approach.&nbsp; He puts the plan into action causing casualties all around him.&nbsp; He doesn’t mind that some of his own team are part of the death toll.&nbsp; This change will happen and everyone else will just learn to accept it.&nbsp; One day, they will be grateful.</p> 
<p>How often have you watched, or worse participated in, this scene?&nbsp; For some reason, a massive change must be made.&nbsp; The reasons may very well be necessary – cost-cutting, market shift, operational efficiencies, etc.&nbsp; A communication strategy perhaps based upon a heartless logic, even if peppered with emotionally-laden verbiage, is distributed.&nbsp; Staff experience anxiety, fear and anger.&nbsp; There’s a lack of willingness to move forward as the company had hoped.&nbsp; Timelines are extended, but deadlines are still missed.&nbsp; Culture is affected; retention strategies begin to crack. &nbsp;Thanos has snapped and people are gone.</p> 
<p>And don’t think that it’s only the big M&amp;A deals that cause this effect.&nbsp; People tend to struggle with change, and they struggle even more with poorly done change, regardless of company size.&nbsp; The HR professional that sits with leadership and develops a plan for change, whatever it may be, with little to no transparency with those to be affected is a setup for failure, even if the plan is good.&nbsp; I once had an employee tell me, “It’s no secret that our organization conducts the survey with no real intention of putting any collaborative effort into the results.”&nbsp; Wow.&nbsp; Leaders might read the results, nod in understanding, agree that there’s no budget and file those results under “One Day, Baby.”&nbsp; The flawed linear, unexplained thinking is not a business help, especially in the current work environment.</p> 
<p>Tension of this sort is not a business driver.&nbsp; Don’t misunderstand.&nbsp; Tension in some circumstances refines people and processes; the friction causes edges to smooth.&nbsp; Yet, when it’s setup from a purely top-down edict, tension is a chokehold.&nbsp; People disconnect, product suffers and innovation stifles.</p> 
<p>Do you need to put that Infinity Stone glove back on? &nbsp;Good.&nbsp; Just be careful with how much snapping you do.</p>

<!--more--><p>The latest statistics tell us that we should focus on anywhere from 10 to 14 competencies (LLAMA, for example, <a href=""http://www.ala.org/llama/leadership-and-management-competencies"">http://www.ala.org/llama/leadership-and-management-competencies</a>) for true growth measurement.&nbsp; Yet, when we look at these competencies, are they really being evaluated?&nbsp; Take out the last job requisition you had.&nbsp; Look at the Job Responsibilities and Job Qualifications sections.&nbsp; Now look at that LLAMA list of competencies.&nbsp; How do they align? Is there a path for progression perhaps? (Don’t weep, it’s okay)</p> 
<p>Of course, the first reality to address here is that it’s very easy for us to lose track of the core.&nbsp; We can get distracted by a manager’s “must haves” in a new hire that we veer ever so slightly off-track.&nbsp; This is particularly the case when an employee leaves and everyone tries to figure out “what we really need.”&nbsp; We wind up looking for someone who needs to have competencies that would work for 2.25 jobs rather than just the one we originally had.&nbsp; From this new reality, a new norm is assumed.&nbsp; And what once was very acceptable for the role is now seen as far removed for our current needs.&nbsp; OK, fine. But is that merely a responsive formation to an individual’s abilities?&nbsp; And what competencies have we stopped looking for because of our new tactic?&nbsp; It may not be working.</p> 
<p>Secondly, developing competencies takes time.&nbsp; And this is not only true for the employee, but for the employer, too.&nbsp; The organization may have a reasonable expectation of the role but then find out that the work being done requires more in certain areas than originally thought.&nbsp; The evolution of position, with corresponding KSAs, is a functional reality.&nbsp; That will take time to assess and measure.&nbsp; It’s okay.&nbsp; Take the time.</p> 
<p>And connected to that, again, is the time is will take for an employee to display a progression in these competencies.&nbsp; Sometimes, it’s not that the employee can’t, it’s that that the employee hasn’t.&nbsp; When managers get frustrated about an employee’s performance, it’s wise to ask about the number of opportunities to display mastery.&nbsp; As of the writing of this blog, <a href=""http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/31283/christian-yelich"">Christian Yelich</a> has the best batting average in baseball; he’s at .337.&nbsp; Think about that.&nbsp; That means he gets a hit about 1/3 of the time he goes to bat.&nbsp; In many organizations, we would have fired someone who only gets a hit 33% of the time.&nbsp; And yet, he is the best right now.&nbsp; What are the comparatives being used?&nbsp; 100%?&nbsp; If so, then you need to be ready to show and defend the perfect “batting average” desired.&nbsp; Batting 1000 is a rarity, but our companies act as if this should be a daily occurrence.&nbsp; Perhaps we’ve let go of someone based on poor competency review parameters.&nbsp; It’s sickening when we realize what we’ve lost because of it. &nbsp;What suckers we are sometimes.</p> 
<p>Finally, think more long term about competencies.&nbsp; While we need short-term wins in our companies, we, also, need to be more attentive to growth in areas of problem solving, emotional intelligence, change and conflict approaches.&nbsp; Those areas, along with others, are not quick in development or experience.&nbsp; Set goals for competencies that look down the road.</p> 
<p>By the way, to save you from Googling it, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_career_batting_average_leaders"">Ty Cobb</a> has the greatest career batting average in all of baseball’s history at .3664 over 24 seasons.&nbsp; He bested Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Rod Carew and Joe DiMaggio, to name a few.&nbsp; Would his 37% success rate at the plate allow him to stay at your organization?&nbsp; No?&nbsp; Look at those assessment and ranking tools again.&nbsp; Swing, Batter!</p>

<!--more--><p>When Derek Zoolander wanted to build <strong>The Center for Children Who Can't Read Good (And Wanna Learn to Do Other Stuff Good Too)</strong>, he knew that just telling kids to read wouldn’t work.&nbsp; They needed to have somewhere to go and to have some direction and steps.&nbsp; Derek was interested in helping kids improve their reading, learn body movement for modeling and grasp the financial life implications in business management (“Hold out for more!”).&nbsp; Even Derek knew that he needed a diverse staff to cover these topics and more.</p> 
<p>What is the learning management plan for your organization?&nbsp; Recently, I had the joy of speaking with my friend, Jason Lauritsen.&nbsp; We spoke about business strategy and awareness, and specifically, the concept of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4dpiyHLWkw&amp;feature=youtu.be"">learning as one of those strategies</a>. &nbsp;It is not shocking to realize the amount of time spent on minutia.&nbsp; Responsive, reactive management rather than considerate, proactive leadership is what takes our time.&nbsp; We’re not engaging staff.&nbsp; For all of the surveys and check-ins we do, what does it get us?</p> 
<p>The differentiator in today’s market leans heavily towards investment in people.&nbsp; Providing a path towards learning – skill development, knowledge improvement and application – are vital from both the employee engagement angle, but also, from a competitive advantage perspective.&nbsp; Despite the fretting done regarding employee retention, we haven’t been thoughtful enough about tactics to keep people invested.&nbsp; While the average employment term is somewhere around 3.5 years, depending on survey data read, those employees who identify as fully engaged with their organizations average almost 7 years.&nbsp; Think about that – almost double.</p> 
<p>Learning strategy is relatively new for many mid-market organizations.&nbsp; It’s not merely installing an LMS and calling it success.&nbsp; The LMS might be part of the strategy, but it’s not the final answer.&nbsp; The point of an LMS is to allow staff to access training, to work at a challenging (but not overwhelming) pace and to achieve subject mastery.&nbsp; Vibrant consideration is needed. Who, what, when, why, how are questions to answer to build learning as an organizational value.</p> 
<p>On average, there is one trainer for every 253 employees in an organization.&nbsp; That’s a large number of people. To think that one trainer is going to lead the charge for all learning for over 250 people would be unwise and impractical.&nbsp; Learning management is more than a curriculum or a presentation.&nbsp; The goal of learning management is to advance the competencies of the individual who will in turn use them to advance, broaden and improve the organization.</p> 
<p>What is the current state of your learning management differentiator at your company?&nbsp; Have you had the discussion around why it’s necessary to have a strategy for learning?&nbsp; Maybe your current learning management goals and strategies are non-existent.&nbsp; Maybe they are just too scattered or without accountability.&nbsp; Maybe they aren’t pushing people to really learn.&nbsp; Maybe the goals are small.&nbsp; Maybe it’s time to do something to shake them up or get them established.&nbsp; Maybe they need to be at least three times as big…</p>

<p>The photo of the current slate of movies out shows a bit of this truth.&nbsp; Did you really think you’d see Toy Story, Men in Black, Godzilla, Spiderman, Aladdin and Child’s Play all back in the theaters?&nbsp; Of course, there are different versions, but isn’t it generally the same? The plotlines feel similar, the characters are developed with a standard pattern; perhaps the graphics are better, but is that enough?</p>
<p>Having recently attended the National SHRM Conference in Las Vegas, I found myself listening in on some of the same conversations we’ve been having for at least 20 years.&nbsp; The same fears, the same threats, the same frustration (perhaps with a slight variance on the details) were the topics of dialogue.&nbsp; Professionals in human resources grappling with the redundancy of process and performance discussions.&nbsp; We’re still discussing time clocks, handbooks, onboarding and discipline.<br><br></p>

<p>In some ways, a space traveler returning to earth after 25 years might not be able to see how business has really evolved.&nbsp; Sure, the tools may be more advanced, but has business advanced?&nbsp; As people experts, we know that our involvement in hearts and minds change the fabric of organizations.&nbsp; For instance, all of the diversity training in the world won’t change people’s approach and consideration until their hearts and minds are impacted.&nbsp; That takes a deliberate, personal touch.</p>
<p>We’ve got to stop singing “A Whole New World” and actual work to create it, however small our power and fiefdom might be.&nbsp; Start where you are.</p>
<p>Attack areas of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communication</li>
<li>Inclusion and Equity</li>
<li>Collaboration</li>
<li>Organizational Structure</li>
<li>Job Duties, Enrichment and Enlargement</li>
<li>Career Progression</li>
<li>Skill Advancement and Knowledge Transfer</li>
<li>Talent Assessment and Alignment</li>
<li>Resource Development, Acquisition and Usage</li>
</ul>
<p>Understand, too, that this consideration is more than just a rally cry.&nbsp; It is a call for consistent change to business approach.&nbsp; In human resources, relegation to tactical, responsive living is commonplace.&nbsp; The truly proactive HR approach is rare.&nbsp; We have to partner with fervor around all business decisions.&nbsp; And if your current role is not one where this approach will work, that’s ok.&nbsp; Support the person in the role that can.&nbsp; Take the tactical off of his/her plate so there’s clear sailing.&nbsp; We’re a team.</p>
<p>We’ve got to wake up before another 25 years of the same conversations occur.&nbsp; For heaven’s sake, people, <a href=""https://smile.amazon.com/s?k=scrunchies&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2"">scrunchies</a> are back on the market and people are wearing them.&nbsp; We can’t let this much history repeat itself!</p>

<!--more--><p>What a mark of trust to be asked this!&nbsp; As the hearer of the question, take a moment to first acknowledge the vulnerability and willingness.&nbsp; Expressions of gratitude are appropriate to share.&nbsp; When someone determines that you are worthy of being asked such a deeply personal question, it is only right to respond with appreciation.&nbsp; The deposits that have been made into this relationship have caused respect to flourish, and now, it’s being expressed.</p> 
<p>Tread carefully in the response to a question like this.&nbsp; Pay close attention to what’s being asked.&nbsp; Sometimes, the question isn’t as direct as “What’s my purpose?” but rather one that’s disguised in questions about performance, fit and advancement.&nbsp; As people, we desire to know that we matter, that our efforts matter and that others are benefitting from our contribution.&nbsp; Even those folks who seem to thrive on irritating others often use that tactic to deflect as a defense mechanism to their own insecurity of purpose.</p> 
<p>One mistake regularly made is to respond to such questions with a generalized answer.&nbsp; “Oh, you’re doing fine” or “Don’t worry about that. No one is complaining” are not the confidence producing responses that will meet the vulnerability expressed initially.&nbsp; Frankly, it could very well lead to that person pulling back in future interactions.&nbsp; When someone is looking for validation and we meet it with a thoughtless answer, it’s more damaging than not responding at all.&nbsp; Think about an answer.</p> 
<p>If you’re not sure how to respond, then share that.&nbsp; It’s okay to be unsure of all that they are asking; just share that.&nbsp; Maybe you can share that you are grateful that they’ve asked this of you.&nbsp; Maybe you can offer some initial thoughts around what you know.&nbsp; But, if you sense that the person is asking more than what you can comment on, then ask for clarity.&nbsp; Over-inflating a response is not a right response either.&nbsp; Vulnerability should be met with honesty.</p> 
<p>Is this too much for you?&nbsp; Perhaps you’re reading this thinking that Baldino has finally snapped into Touchy-Feely World.</p> 
<p>We’re in an economy of purpose. “<em>An organization’s culture of purpose answers the critical questions of who it is and why it exists. They have a culture of purpose beyond making a profit. An organization’s culture of purpose answers the critical questions of who we are and why we exist through a set of carefully articulated core beliefs. A culture of purpose guides behavior, influences strategy, transcends leaders–and endures”</em> (Punit Renjen, Deloitte Global CEO, 2014).&nbsp; For the last five years, as the truth of this has permeated our markets, some companies have avoided it.</p> 
<p>People want to know how they fit into the grand scheme.&nbsp; The values of an organization mean something more than pithy wishes or marketable phrases.&nbsp; Those values translate into how people find purpose in the work they do.&nbsp; They want to believe that the work done brings value to the organization and to the clientele supported.&nbsp; Existence is vitally connected to work; how does what I do enrich or enhance the lives of those around me?</p> 
<p>Approach questions of purpose gingerly, but willingly.&nbsp; Let staff know that such consideration is normal.&nbsp; We want to know that we have a purpose to our lives.&nbsp; Purpose acts as a cement for excellence in work.</p>

"Humareso Blog","Mr. Roboto","Mr. Roboto – Humareso","en","https://blog.humareso.com/mr-roboto","John Baldino","","For the past few years, the topic of the future of work has continued to stir enthusiasm, fear and opinion within the business community.  Most times, when","2019-05-30 04:00:00","2022-05-26T21:12:53.505Z","<p>For the past few years, the topic of the future of work has continued to stir enthusiasm, fear and opinion within the business community.&nbsp; Most times, when the future of work is discussed, visions of Rosie dance in our heads.&nbsp; You know, Rosie from The Jetsons.&nbsp; We envision AI (artificial intelligence) handling our problems and making our work lives much more freed up and bearable.&nbsp; Rosie seemed to do that on screen.&nbsp; She had an arm appear with all sorts of tools – vacuums, brooms, hands to cook, wash dishes, dust.&nbsp; And all of this happened simultaneously. Just like what we think AI will do.</p> 
<!--more--><p>The news should probably be broken for you.&nbsp; Rosie was a cartoon.&nbsp; Real life doesn’t work that way.&nbsp; We would have drawn our hopes on the screens of life long ago if it was possible.&nbsp; Instead, we should approach this subject of the future of work from all that it’s meant to encompass.</p> 
<p>Firstly, the future of work is partly defined by the talent force to handle it. &nbsp;This means that areas of learning management, skill development and process improvement have to be assessed and upgraded.&nbsp; The talent of tomorrow do not necessarily know what they don’t know either.&nbsp; If organizations are just banking on recent college graduates filling them in on what they should know, that is a recipe for disappointment.&nbsp; There is an inherent and internal responsibility for an organization to assess what trends it has to be ready for, what the competition is doing and what advancements are being made in product or service.&nbsp; Passivity is not a strategy. Attack the future of work.</p> 
<p>The future of work is, also, about flexibility.&nbsp; How can work be done better, more efficiently and less micro-managed?&nbsp; Part of the answer lies in how the workforce can function.&nbsp; The contractor portion of the workforce may replace some internal workers through the natural phasing out of certain roles or tasks, along with the clearer desire of some staff to work independently (everyone’s an entrepreneur!).&nbsp; With work from home or remote work opportunities, our talent can succeed in new ways.&nbsp; Directed collaboration in areas of process and innovation through video chats or Slack communication are things we could not have been convinced of ten years ago (even five, really!).</p> 
<p>But there is more to the workforce in the future of work then just flexibility.&nbsp; It’s, also, about equity.&nbsp; The impact of diversity and inclusion is a build up to equity, and the future of work demands it.&nbsp; The workforce needs more than mere representation; it needs equal participation.&nbsp; It’s not an accident that most equity-based teams succeed more than others (<a href=""https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/why-diversity-matters"">McKinsey</a>) and that is because the effort is around impact rather than just a visibly diverse team.&nbsp; The future of work will have to lean on this truth; it will no longer be optional.&nbsp; And lest you think this is merely wishful thinking or an attempt at some Jedi mind trick, <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/serenitygibbons/2018/12/11/why-diversity-should-be-focused-on-impact-not-equity/#1263549f3e73"">Forbes</a> (and others) has been pushing impact through diversity, inclusion AND equity for some time and they’ve studied it.</p> 
<p>It’s, also, clear that technology will have a vibrant place in the future of work.&nbsp; For those organizations just getting into mobile employee experience, geo-specific time clocks and live chat features on their website, you’ve got some ground to cover.&nbsp; The adoption of AI has begun, and while it all hasn’t worked perfectly, it’s worked enough to keep us refining it and seeking more.&nbsp; Those repetitive tasks are being off-loaded to “thinking” software to handle with more precision and predictability than we’ve had as people (yikes, thank you, Hal…I hope you know who Hal is).</p> 
<p>The future of work will, also, require you to ask for help.&nbsp; You will need to spend more on technology, yes, but you will, also, need to spend on consultants.&nbsp; Look into resources to assist with the preparation needed.&nbsp; The future is coming.&nbsp; You can welcome it with open arms or be slapped hard by one of Rosie’s mechanical arms.&nbsp; Your choice.</p>

<!--more--><p>Often, as business professionals, we think that those reviewing our work might have it in for us.&nbsp; We put detailed stories together in our minds using scraps of truth in conversations or, worse yet, mere glances from the QC person that we allege cut us to the core.&nbsp; We look for trouble and we’re likely to manufacture it.&nbsp; We will find an audience who wants to hear it.&nbsp; We then feel justified.</p> 
<p>While it may be that some individual who sits in a QC capacity becomes power-wielding in attitude and function, those situations are rare.&nbsp; Not everyone is out to get you, really.&nbsp; Your work needs a review from time to time.&nbsp; Welcome it.&nbsp; Ask for it.</p> 
<p>In many ways, quality control is a path towards self-reflection.&nbsp; Reflection is a brutal discipline.&nbsp; Looking inward can expose flaws, fears and failures with which we’d rather not deal.&nbsp; It’s why using our minds to create drama to deflect is a knee-jerk reaction.&nbsp; It’s self-protection.&nbsp; Push through that so you can deal with the demons.&nbsp; It’s just in those moments of reflection when clarity sets in.&nbsp; We see things for what they are, not what we’ve ascribed them to be or what we’ve hoped they were.&nbsp; Quality control keeps us honest.</p> 
<p>In our attempts to get ahead, we may have opted for shortcuts that have shortchanged us.&nbsp; We may have circumvented opportunities for certain skill development, conflict management consideration and technical learning.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Evaluation would have to be a part of those developmental opportunities.&nbsp; Someone would have to review what we have done well, what still needs improvement and what is way off of the mark.&nbsp; We don’t like our work QC’d by nature.&nbsp; We default to avoiding such involvement.&nbsp; And it’s just the thing we need.</p> 
<p>If you work in an environment where someone does not regularly, if ever, looks at your performance, ask for review.&nbsp; Invite someone to QC what you do.&nbsp; Keep yourself honest.&nbsp; Use those reviews to self-reflect and to determine process changes, courses of action and trajectory of work.&nbsp; That’s the secret of success, really.&nbsp; Our accountability pushes us towards excellence.&nbsp; Embrace QC.</p>

<!--more--><p>Nick represented the very worst that a parent would hope for their child – an out of work artist with a lack of formal education and few prospects for the future.&nbsp; This is gold for a sitcom.&nbsp; And while Mallory’s devotion for Nick and her commitment to seeing the best in him made their relationship endearing, it was not the reality her family saw.</p> 
<p>Seeing what isn’t there might be your current MO.&nbsp; Have you been maintaining a hope for an employee who just won’t rise to the expectation?&nbsp; How have you PIP’d yourself silly with this person?&nbsp; Have you spent too much time justifying continued employment?&nbsp; Count how many “but” sentences you endure when discussing this person with the manager.&nbsp; We may indulgently over-qualify the employee by continuing a stance of defensiveness.&nbsp; We may, also, send a clear message to the other staff as to what our values or expectations actually are for employment and contribution.</p> 
<p>When I was in 8<sup>th</sup> grade, the school decided to purposely mix the very best of the class with the very worst of the class (academically) in the hopes that the best would influence the worst.&nbsp; Since you’re a reasonable person, you can imagine what happened.&nbsp; The best was less than inspired and often threatened not to do well.&nbsp; It was a failed experiment.&nbsp; The school needed to address the issues with the “worst” and help them to move along incrementally instead of the goal of valedictorian.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Look at who is taxing your time.&nbsp; Why are they?&nbsp; Why do you have the expectations you do?&nbsp; Honestly look at it.&nbsp; There is not room for multiple “Nicks” at any organization.&nbsp; It must be dealt with in a constructive, non-desperate manner.</p> 
<p>But think about this entire situation from the other side.&nbsp; What if instead of Nick being an individual employee, he is the organization itself?&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The impact of the employee experience matters.&nbsp; Organizations need to do some deep introspection to determine if they’ve painted a less than appealing picture of what it means to work for the company.&nbsp; Organizations may spend more time on the appearance of being a worthy landing spot rather than actually being a worthy landing spot.&nbsp; You can put lipstick on a pig, but it’s still a pig.&nbsp; You can ride around in a Benz, but you might still be a scrub.&nbsp; Is your company a scrub?</p> 
<p>The effort it takes to give the appearance of a great place to work (or employer of choice, as so many like to say they are) might be better directed to being a great place to work.&nbsp; Look at the initiatives around learning management, job enlargement, collaboration, transparency and equity.&nbsp; The organization should be leveraging its positives to impact areas of concern or development.&nbsp; Refine objectives and uphold values in those goals.&nbsp; Introduce consistency in a fresh way to process and to communication.&nbsp; There is good work to be done here.</p> 
<p>You’ve entered a relationship when you accept an offer of employment.&nbsp; You’ve decided to put the very best of who you are in the service of a company.&nbsp; The company has decided to invest resources into this relationship, too.&nbsp; An organization should offer its very best to staff.&nbsp; It’s meant to be a fluid, supportive relationship.&nbsp; Perhaps it’s time to do a relationship check.</p>

<!--more--><p>Most managers have learned technique in the same way.&nbsp; They haven’t really been taught how to manage.&nbsp; Instead, they’ve been allowed to respond in a way that mirrors their upbringing.&nbsp; If you are the older brothers who bullied the younger, then you’ll likely oversee your team in a similar manner.&nbsp; If you are the younger brother, you’ll either be a pushover or respond defiantly to any supposed pushback.&nbsp; It’s a cantankerous management style, and with managers being one of the largest reasons people leave employers, it’s not the recipe for success.</p> 
<p>It's important to note that this is not just a male to male pattern.&nbsp; Statistically, we see similar components from female to female or cross-gender.&nbsp; It’s not an issue of nature but of nurture.&nbsp; The environment early on forms the patterns of wielding authority.</p> 
<p>And understand that this is a systemic pattern; modeling at its best.&nbsp; We reap what we sow.&nbsp; Senior executives might polish up part of their forward-facing act, but behind closed doors, it’s adolescence amped.&nbsp; We are creatures of habit so without real behavioral modification and partnered accountability, it’s not likely to change.&nbsp; And while vulnerability is a difficult skill to put on, trust is a difficult reality to live without.&nbsp; Poor management corrupts cultures through playing favorites, over-reacting responsiveness and immature positioning.</p> 
<p>Intention is the master of deception here, too.&nbsp; It’s like the crime of New Year’s resolutions – we mean well but we stink at keeping them.&nbsp; After a particularly tough interaction with a team member, a manager may lick his/her wounds and recognize the need for personal change.&nbsp; The intention is true; the unaccountable measures won’t last.&nbsp; We will slip back into patterns, habits and biases.&nbsp; We can’t wish our way to better management skills, and our training cannot be one and done curriculum.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Experience teaches us what works.&nbsp; If organizations are systemically based on bullying, rough interactions and dictatorial management, then fear, mistrust and demotivation rule the day.&nbsp; A manager, despite realizing the error of his/her ways, will need to climb a mountain of bad attitudes and corrupted interaction.&nbsp; Handing a manager a book and saying, “Read this, it will help” is ludicrous. And yet, we all have watched band aids being offered to managers who are cut deeply and who have cut deeply.&nbsp; It’s not a quick fix.&nbsp; Buckle up and do the work.</p> 
<p>Categoric change will have to be done as a team of people (at least a pair of people).&nbsp; It will take more than one mouth to affirm what is changing and why it is changing.&nbsp; Trust takes time to build, especially if it’s being rebuilt.&nbsp; People will need to hear and to see change from more than one authority.&nbsp; Executives and managers will need to implement a course correction on communication – its boundaries, its intent and its style.&nbsp; Managers will slip into personal commentary (and sometimes, attack) and that is not the right pathway for all process and procedural enforcement.&nbsp; Someone doesn’t suck; someone may be poor at a particular skill or responsibility.&nbsp; There is an inherent difference.&nbsp; And for many organizations, this is step one.&nbsp; Address the skill, not the quality of the person.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Listen, my skin is relatively thick (there are sensitive spots, for sure) but I recognize a default of attack that bubbles within me when challenged.&nbsp; Early on, I was admonished for who I was, not what I was attempting to do.&nbsp; When I don’t know how to do something, I am not stupid.&nbsp; When I am unfamiliar with my environment, I am not a scaredy cat.&nbsp; When I make a mistake, I am not a failure.&nbsp; And yet, managers and supervisors specifically stated or heavily inferred these assessments in their daily management of me, and I am not alone in this experience.&nbsp; It’s time to undo this type of communication.&nbsp; It leads us nowhere but downward.</p> 
<p>Create management training that is ongoing, accountable, connected to performance management and holistic in approach.&nbsp; Louder programs get attention, but that doesn’t mean lasting impact.&nbsp; Adding power doesn’t mean success.&nbsp; Just ask Tim the Toolman.</p>

<!--more--><p>We, the people, are funny and fickle.&nbsp; And while there may be times that the first season or album are all that we need (future blog coming on this!), what might it say about us that our initial offerings of praise are replaced later with criticism, assumptions about performance and even, venomous words.&nbsp; Our infatuation with how things were constricts us.</p> 
<p>Nostalgia is a beautiful thing.&nbsp; I can hear a song or see a photo and be transported to a different time and environment.&nbsp; It’s almost palpable.&nbsp; I see the walls of a room, the gymnasium of the high school or the waves crashing against the shore.&nbsp; I can smell the sweaty locker room after practice, the sweet bouquet of my wife’s hair or the homemade gravy (sauce for you non-Philly Italians) in my grandparents’ kitchen.&nbsp; I can feel my hand being held by one of my kids or the grip on the steering wheel on my first car.&nbsp; We fantasize about time travel when a song, photo, book or movie can transport us faster than the speed of light.</p> 
<p>Nostalgia is a distraction.&nbsp; Just as beautifully as nostalgia can make us feel, it serves as an unintended anchor to a time never to happen again.&nbsp; We can long for a return to when things were better, easier, less crazy.&nbsp; The rose-colored glasses we wear when looking back blind us to the rough patches, the pain of heartbreak and to the truth of its story.</p> 
<p>It’s why change can be so very difficult for us. &nbsp;“That’s not how we’ve done it” becomes a badge of honor to wear during transition or advancement in an organization.&nbsp; And while the context might not be some story about winning the state championship on 4<sup>th</sup> and 22 from our own 30-yard line, we hold onto the memory of how good a certain process is.&nbsp; I’ve known dedicated workers, who regularly complained about a system, stage a coup to revolt against a change to that system.&nbsp; And though it sounds irrational (and it just might be), it is easy to understand.&nbsp; The known means power over it.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>We can craft the story we want and manipulate the pieces to suit our needs.&nbsp; Even in our complaining, we own it.&nbsp; We know well the failures of the process and will heartily share those but introduce something to change it and watch the complaining move from what is known to the unknown about to take over.&nbsp; The benefits of that broken system will be brought to the forefront.&nbsp; “Yeah, I know that the other system was broken, but this new one just can’t work.”&nbsp; We won’t allow the next iteration to thrive.&nbsp; We derail ourselves and it’s difficult for us to see that as it’s happening.</p> 
<p>Resistance to change serves no one.&nbsp; Our knee-jerk reaction is to recall how glorious things were and how this new reality has ruined what once was.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Change isn’t only a business imperative, it’s a personal reality.&nbsp; The best way to shake the ill-attached sentiment of nostalgia is to label what life was really like.&nbsp; A song can take me back to that sweaty locker room where I spent hours running track in high school, but not all those memories are great.&nbsp; I was an insecure teenager trying to find his way.&nbsp; That’s not a great feeling, but it’s part of the story.&nbsp; It wasn’t all bad, but it wasn’t all good.&nbsp; It just was.&nbsp; And my kids don’t hold my hand like they used to, but they are now moving into the next phase of life and it’s a joy to watch them shine.&nbsp; My tears at their departure should not make me resistant or non-supportive; I have been a part of their journey.&nbsp; I am to celebrate their successful navigation of life to date.&nbsp; To resist is a waste of energy; to sit and cry is okay at moments, but to stay in that state is debilitating and affects my view of reality.&nbsp; Change at work is not much different.</p> 
<p>Things were not as great as you might think.&nbsp; The next iteration might not feel the same way as the last.&nbsp; Embrace it.&nbsp; Complaining about something you’ve not done is fruitless; refusing to change is stagnation and irrelevance.&nbsp; Truth is truth, but the process that’s being altered may not be something to dig your heels in for.&nbsp; Grip those core truths in your life and hold fast; use your energy then to travel the road of change in procedure, product and process.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>When I would dance alone in my room as a 13-year old, I never dreamed that I would be using a laptop computer to write, taking breaks to check my smartphone for emails, tweets and texts.&nbsp; Not all change is bad.&nbsp; And the change yet to come might not be either.</p>

<!--more--><p>Picked yourself up off the floor?&nbsp; I doubt you were even fazed by that news.&nbsp; But what I did notice more acutely was how many complainers were managers.&nbsp; More specifically, I heard managers of teams share their negative thoughts with staff.&nbsp; I heard managers of HR share critical thoughts about other managers and executives that would be difficult for someone to forget they’ve heard.&nbsp; I have heard C-Suite leaders passive-aggressively deal with managers and staff in a demeaning manor.&nbsp; Rough week!</p> 
<p>The challenge is around how we share critique without being critical of others.&nbsp; It’s around how we give people details without giving people judgment.&nbsp; It’s about how to remain clear on the story without instilling anecdotal information to distract.&nbsp; Many of us slide very easily into the unhealthy approach to information-sharing.&nbsp; We provide too much attitude and too many opinions.</p> 
<p>And while some of this is a behavioral adjustment (breaking a habit), it is, also, a matter of setting tone and objectives.&nbsp; When my folks told me to not smoke cigarettes, it was because they cared for my health and well-being.&nbsp; When they told me while they both were smokers, it was a weird message to receive.&nbsp; If it’s so bad, why are you doing it? (I am happy to say that both have since quit).&nbsp; Think about your workplaces. If I ask you to speak professionally and provide excellent customer service, but I don’t demonstrate those qualities amongst the team, isn’t it just as weird?&nbsp; It’s incongruous.&nbsp; What I do betrays what I say.&nbsp; The tone of the expectation is understood differently.&nbsp; It’s more of a “don’t get caught breaking this rule, but if you can do it and not get caught, it’s cool” attitude.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>When managers, human resources professionals, supervisors and executives speak in back-stabbing innuendos, trust is damaged.&nbsp; It bears saying that the trust is broken even if the words aren’t about the person to whom it’s being directed.&nbsp; When I know you are willing to be so critical about someone to me, I am left to fill in the blanks of your shared words to others about me.&nbsp; I cannot trust your actions when I am not around. &nbsp;The inconsistency is not lost on the hearers.&nbsp; Your actions matter.</p> 
<p>What might be most disheartening in this reality is the role that human resources plays in keeping this type of culture active in organizations.&nbsp; Many of us participate too readily in the tearing down of others.&nbsp; And while you may already be judging me for saying it (now just stop that!), think about the eye rolls, the head shaking, the negative words and the unhinged rants that you have offered since the year began.&nbsp; Have you unwittingly set a tone that you try to fight against?&nbsp; Tearing people down is easy; it’s the opportunity to build up that takes more effort.</p> 
<p>Listen, it’s fine to have those safe people to whom you can share how you’re feeling or what you’re observing.&nbsp; That’s a good thing in whatever role we have.&nbsp; But if your safe people circle is about 15 deep, it’s too many.&nbsp; And if some of those people you work with daily, there will be difficulty in flipping back and forth in the relationship.&nbsp; Choose wisely the few you can lean on.&nbsp; And outside of those few, maintain the tone and objectives you need to.&nbsp; The consistency in expected communication has to come from you first.&nbsp; Model the right behavior.</p> 
<p>One of the conversations I overheard this week was a restaurant manager sharing with her team, right after she hung up the phone, that the customer was calling to see where her delivery order was.&nbsp; It had not yet arrived.&nbsp; The manager couldn’t believe that this customer was so annoying.&nbsp; “I mean, I told her we’re on own way. We’re only like 10 minutes late so far.”&nbsp; And what did she now tell her team?&nbsp; That it’s reasonable to be late.&nbsp; That it’s not our fault if we don’t meet our promised services.&nbsp; That it’s okay to treat customers poorly once you’re no longer speaking to them.&nbsp; That others in the venue, who could overhear this, should know that service offered is based upon how reasonable the restaurant thinks you are.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>So, what’s a first step?&nbsp; Wait before you share.&nbsp; Don’t involve others until you know what you want you want to say and how you want to deliver it.&nbsp; And is the information going to be in keeping with the desired tone and intended objectives?&nbsp; There’s often not a rush to deliver information, even though we think there is.&nbsp; Consider, then deliver.</p>

He would head to the club after work to dance his cares away and be someone that he really wanted to be.&nbsp; The show lasted nine episodes, despite the theme song being a top 10 hit for David Naughton. “Makin’ It” didn’t make it.</p> 
<!--more--><p>It may have been more appropriate to call the show, “We Hope This Makes It.” &nbsp;That may, also, be the title of our last hire.&nbsp; Or maybe the title of that last new vertical or initiative we tried to launch.&nbsp; Or maybe the title of the benefits package given to employees.&nbsp; A hope and a prayer, promoted with a cool logo or slogan, won’t make something be more than it really is.</p> 
<p>When we look at these hires or initiatives, it is not usually that we’ve intended to set things up to fail.&nbsp; We actually walk in with the best of intentions.&nbsp; The ideology is grounded, the qualifications firm and the intended results seem clear.&nbsp; We struggle with the follow through and evaluation.&nbsp; The premise of that late 1970’s show was not bad at all.&nbsp; It was a relatable concept that most viewers should have taken to.&nbsp; We like to see people succeed, even in small ways, and we can live vicariously in that brief time.&nbsp; And with a hit song moving up the charts, there should have been momentum to carry interest forward.&nbsp; The show did not plan for long-term success with its mediocre writing and weak acting (not David Naughton!).&nbsp; A hit song towards the end of the disco era was not enough.</p> 
<p>In our organizations, we may find ourselves working off old job descriptions, old job processes or an outdated understanding of competitive markets.&nbsp; Those realities will influence our understanding of need and value.&nbsp; When social media took its hold on marketing strategies, companies wound up adding a line item to the job description stating that the individual in the role needed to manage the social media of the company.&nbsp; While that might be a right responsibility, no one had done the work to understand the depth behind such a duty.&nbsp; And those same companies have had a parade of employees labeled as “Marketing Associate” or “Social Media Manager” who did not make it.&nbsp; The label was not enough to ensure success for the true work to be done.</p> 
<p>This type of labeling isn’t the discriminatory kind, but rather the kind that gives an appearance of addressing a need.&nbsp; Our organizations need to know why and how that need is to be met in a role, a process and or a new department.&nbsp; The resolution to act has to be met with more than a one-time proclamation, but rather one where plans are defined and outcomes measured.&nbsp; Resources are set aside to support this initiative.&nbsp; Those involved understand clearly where Point B is as they stand on Point A.&nbsp; Calling someone a Manager doesn’t make it so.&nbsp; What are you doing to support his/her success?</p> 
<p>In our organizations, titles and project names should have teeth.&nbsp; The whys and hows will allow our teams to know where this is going and how it keeps the company ahead of the competition.&nbsp; Those labels should bring encouragement to all involved, not quick disappointment when it’s realized to just be fluff.&nbsp; Sharpen the teeth of intention by sharpening your pencils and developing full plans.&nbsp; Giving the label is the easy part; the work in getting that person to make it is something much more involved.&nbsp;</p>

No, I am not talking about me (though I can understand your thinking).&nbsp; I am referring to the best annual conference I attend – WorkHuman.&nbsp; Over the past five years, this conference has grown into the premier event of the year for those interested in advancing the human condition.&nbsp;</p> 
<!--more--><p>I recently reviewed a video of a business owner who was spouting off about how horrible human resources is.&nbsp; The basic sentiment was that HR is a loss leader and is only there to keep you compliant and out of some lawsuits, but mostly, they are a waste of time.&nbsp; He shared that HR was the killjoy to most business opportunities and would often pander to the whiners and complainers at work.&nbsp; It was almost painful to watch, but I had to admit that some of the characterization, albeit harsh, was earned.</p> 
<p>The investment at WorkHuman is that of consideration, conversation and innovation.&nbsp; When these business owners, HR professionals and entrepreneurs get together, we specifically address all that it means to be human in the workplace.&nbsp; We address communication needs, social issues, human stressors, encouragement and confidence.&nbsp; People need to be challenged, yes, but also affirmed and guided.&nbsp; We want to get the most out of each other, not merely for the business.</p> 
<p>We’ve likely worked for companies that have taken our very best, used it for gain and then offered us a $25 gift card as an extra thanks.&nbsp; That’s not a long-term strategy.&nbsp; That proliferates the view that organizations have forgotten (if they ever knew) how to treat people.&nbsp; And while that may seem like a generalization, bear in mind that most employee engagement statistics have remained fairly level for the last twenty years.&nbsp; Our efforts cannot be programmatic, but rather should be transformative.&nbsp; How do we make a lasting change to our inner-workings and dynamic?</p> 
<p>That’s the magic of WorkHuman.&nbsp; It faces this head on.&nbsp; George Clooney, Viola Davis and Geena Davis, will share their thoughts on culture, diversity and social responsibility.&nbsp; Cy Wakeman will help us understand our conditioned response to blame and to deflect.&nbsp; Kat Cole will take us on a journey of empowerment and risk.&nbsp; The lineup goes on for days, literally.</p> 
<p>Tackling the human condition at our workplaces is vital for our competitive advantage as well as for our retention and learning strategies.&nbsp; Engaging with the vibrancy of ideas such as this is powerfully palpable and will change your approach to performance and recognition in your organizations.</p>

<!--more--><p>Who is your Dennis?&nbsp; Perhaps you have a crew of Dennises darkening your doorway each and every day.&nbsp; It’s not so cute having such a waiting line each day, is it?&nbsp; And that positive attitude you’re determined to maintain in the morning slowly turns into scowling bitterness or passive-aggressive faux smiles.&nbsp; Each day, you look for whatever hashtag motivation you can find to stop the inevitable responses you offer.&nbsp; Keep your chin up! (insert cheesy Scholastic Books poster of the month)</p> 
<p>From a capability standpoint, look inward.&nbsp; Think first about the likelihood of your situation changing.&nbsp; Too often, competent people believe that once a software product or process change is implemented, the world will upend and life will be returned to glory for you.&nbsp; Certainly, there should be changes as a result of such an implementation.&nbsp; The flow of data, the responsibilities of the employee and manager, the employee experience in accessing information and making necessary edits, and the improvement to productivity should be measured now that these changes were put into place.&nbsp; Yet, it may not mean (and often does not) that interaction with people is replaced or removed.</p> 
<p>Further, are you practicing good techniques for managing the annoyances?&nbsp; These open-door policies that we pride ourselves on are not really meant to make us sit at the whim of the next person who has a hangnail.&nbsp; And if you have a couple of particularly draining folks regularly eager to chat with you, it’s like brushing your teeth with sandpaper.&nbsp; We don’t have to really care about every little iota, but we do need to have an outlet for employees to work through those work-related issues.&nbsp; But, it’s okay to shut the door at times to handle the other parts of your role.&nbsp; Those victories will embolden you to better deal with the reopening of the door.&nbsp; The pressure of the next item on the checklist will not be as sharp.&nbsp; </p> 
<p>The mobility of the workforce today is vital.&nbsp; Somewhere along the way, however, we may have believed that this would remove the annoyance of dealing with people.&nbsp; That unspoken expectation will exasperate us.&nbsp; Challenge the basis of expectations first.&nbsp; Why do you think the way you think in this area?&nbsp; If you’re in a people-centric role, then no amount of software or distance will change the amount of communication you’ll be having.&nbsp; </p> 
<p>Do you know how to manage the conversation?&nbsp; The person who sits in your office for an hour to discuss a situation might not need that long.&nbsp; Lead that dialogue while clearly listening to the employee.&nbsp; It’s an art, and it is one that needs skill development.&nbsp; And it is an amplified skill in the world of remote workers.&nbsp; Rapport development will assist greatly in mitigating conversations from being elongated.&nbsp; How do you develop healthy rapport with workers equally – whether in the office or remotely?&nbsp; </p> 
<p>Seek the wisdom of those you observe in other departments doing a better job of managing difficult people.&nbsp; Study their techniques, ask for thought processes and practice what you’re taking in.&nbsp; This is a better use of energy, rather than storing up frustrations and losing it at random times.&nbsp; Explosions don’t work.&nbsp; Passive-aggression does not work.&nbsp; Talking crap about people behind their backs does nothing to move an organization forward.&nbsp; You need to sit with your “Dennis” and listen with intentional boundaries of time and topic.&nbsp; The truth is you do care. &nbsp;Let’s just do it with the right tools and time.</p>

<!--more--><p>The study of happiness is no longer just a fad.&nbsp; It’s not that we must work to make others happy, but rather, we’re challenged to consider the environment we shape and whether that is conducive to achieving happiness and contentment.&nbsp; This work has been evaluated and studied much more over the last decade, and the data comes to us from a global perspective.&nbsp; The Nordic region of the globe have most recently been assessed to be the happiest people, and yet, that does not mean everyone maintains an ethereal glow of happy.</p> 
<p style=""text-align: right""><em>“Despite the fact that we in the Nordic countries consistently top the international rankings of subjective well-being and satisfaction with life, many Danes, Finns, Icelanders, Norwegians and Swedes still experience that they are struggling or suffering (i.e. the opposite of happiness)…When all of the variables (life circumstances) are tested in relation to their explanatory power for states of struggling or suffering, we find a number of significant relations. Life circumstances such as poor general health, poor mental health, income, unemployment, limited social contact and religiosity (the degree to which one has faith in a religion) all play a role. However, some factors are far more significant than others”</em> (<strong>In the Shadow of Happiness</strong>, Nordic Council of Ministers, 2018).</p> 
<p>Those variables listed overlap greatly into the modern workforce.&nbsp; Organizations influence access to affordable healthcare through coverages.&nbsp; They affect compensation levels through salary banding or grading opportunities. &nbsp;And human interaction can be steadily influenced by collaborative efforts, think tanks, committees, etc. in the workplace.&nbsp; The power of leadership and its ability to forge healthy roads in these areas will be tested.&nbsp; People want these levels of support and opportunity. &nbsp;Can your leadership commit to it?</p> 
<p>And before some of you think this is mumbo-jumbo, feel-good crapola, Shawn Achor has been studying this since the early 2000’s.&nbsp; “<a href=""https://hbr.org/2011/06/the-happiness-dividend"">A decade of research proves that happiness raises nearly every business and educational outcome: raising sales by 37%, productivity by 31%, and accuracy on tasks by 19%, as well as a myriad of health and quality of life improvements</a>.” We have a competitive consideration or two in this!&nbsp; For many in management, you may already be acutely aware of these needs to bolster employee engagement and performance.&nbsp; What is likely lacking is a plan to make it happen.</p> 
<p>It's time to sit with leadership to review options for improvement, not just in the offerings in some of these “struggle” areas, but also in the communication plan of what is already in place.&nbsp; The experience of the workforce is often ignorance in what they have access to, and without clarity, they default into thinking it’s not there.&nbsp; And to be fair, does management truly know what it has?&nbsp; Be diligent in the conversations with brokers and vendors, with county agencies and with civic groups to see what you can access right now.&nbsp; Often, companies are surprised to learn how much is available to their staff.</p> 
<p>Further, inequity can stymie happiness.&nbsp; Is the impression in your organization that only some get access to perks, fair consideration, support?&nbsp; Some departments may be underserved due to poor leadership or non-intentional communication.&nbsp; Break through those perceived inequities.&nbsp; Of course, if your organization is operating in conscious bias, there are amplified issues of employees that are struggling or suffering.&nbsp; It may be worth a focus group chat, representing employees across departments and levels of responsibilities.&nbsp; Ask them what their experiences have been like.</p> 
<p>While we’re not the happiness police, we are keepers of factors influencing it.&nbsp; Ferris was able to get to Cameron in a way that no one else could.&nbsp; He would diagnose and treat Cameron accordingly.&nbsp; Let’s be a little more like Ferris in review of our organizations. </p>

<!--more--><p>After being a recluse of decades, William Forrester has an encounter with Jamal Wallace that brings him out of “life retirement.” (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181536/"">Finding Forrester</a>, 2000). The diabolic belief that we can break through a siloed way of life with just a touch of love is ludicrous.&nbsp; Most people need illumination to the path out of their own private Idaho.&nbsp; It doesn’t just happen.</p> 
<p>In our organizations, we sit in silos despite our denial of such a reality.&nbsp; We “collaborate” on tasks, but not as much on ideology and strategy.&nbsp; We see marketing, IT and human resources work on a project plan together for the implementation of some digital transformation initiative, but do we see them truly operate in a holistic, strategic approach beyond this project?&nbsp; The project is good, for sure, to start opening doors for communication and understanding; however, the oft-happening truth is that those in-roads are cutoff once the project is completed.</p> 
<p>Part of the issue is paranoia.&nbsp; Too many of us still believe that our efforts are best spent jockeying for position and relevance in our organizations.&nbsp; We can’t let others in without questions being asked about duties, scope and plans.&nbsp; To answer those questions would mean potential exposure to our thinking and our approach.&nbsp; Uh oh.</p> 
<p>Rather, we should want those questions asked.&nbsp; Improvement is tied closely to transparency.&nbsp; And true collaboration is more than just a project; it’s a strategic approach to organizational development and effectiveness.&nbsp; It takes more than just a post-project congratulatory luncheon to get people to work at this level.&nbsp; It’s a leadership-influenced driver.&nbsp; Does your executive team understand how they’re going to get where their strategic road map shows them going?&nbsp; The chart is pretty, but it’s not a wall-breaker to silos.&nbsp; What will penetrate those walls permanently?</p> 
<p>Typically, part of the answer lies in the people in those positions.&nbsp; There is a capability quotient to this and knowing to what degree your people can handle it is vital.&nbsp; Some organizations spend years trying to get managers to grow into proactive, strategic roles.&nbsp; Some people cannot do it.&nbsp; Drop the idealism of rescue.&nbsp; Not everyone will exit William Forrester’s apartment. Some will step into the hallway for a brief time, but then retreat back.&nbsp; Often, leadership will take those hallway moments as a sign that someone can be redeemed fully; that is not so.</p> 
<p>Assessment should not be overlooked here, but it usually is.&nbsp; It seems wasteful of resources.&nbsp; And yet, think of it this way, when you want to consistently change habits, you have to seek support to get out of that mode of thinking and behavior.&nbsp; We see this in physical wellness, in financial planning, in dealing with emotional trauma…why would this behavioral and psychological change be any different?&nbsp; Encouragement towards real, effectual transformation should be the goal.&nbsp; Once this is committed to, you will see that some will not have the desire or stamina to join in with you.&nbsp; </p> 
<p>Organizational health requires the removal of silos which are based upon fear, power and unchecked behavior.&nbsp; Our companies are meant for something greater, not just idealistically, but competitively.&nbsp; Knock on Forrester’s door and find out whether he’s ready to exit.&nbsp; Ask him/her.&nbsp; Point blank. &nbsp;</p>

He was in some sort of frozen hyper-sleep in his ship which was then found in the 25<sup>th</sup> Century.&nbsp; He was resuscitated, began to acclimate to the new world order and was given a weapon.&nbsp; Buck, though a stranger to the new world, jumped in devotedly to the “good guys’ cause.” </p> 
<!--more--><p>Devotion is a trait business owners want from their staff.&nbsp; It’s one of those loyalty-based considerations that we readily equate to employee engagement.&nbsp; And yet, what is loyalty?&nbsp; Most HR professionals have differing definitions, let alone the various definitions that other C-Suite executives would have.&nbsp; </p> 
<p>Loyalty =</p> 
<ul>
 <li>Years of service</li>
 <li>Working long hours (usually with no additional perks)</li>
 <li>Taking on crap jobs that no one else wants</li>
 <li>Believing in the various missions and visions of the organization through the years</li>
</ul> 
<p>There are plenty of definitions or highlights of a loyal person, but do they shed light on what loyalty really is?&nbsp; Is loyalty just about the job you’re doing or hope to do?&nbsp; Ideally, engagement and devotion are to be characteristics of stability in the organization.&nbsp; If it’s easily moved by the work of the day, then there can be no confidence in it.&nbsp; </p> 
<p>Instead, loyalty is connected to a belief in success.&nbsp; The <a href=""https://opentextbc.ca/businessethicsopenstax/chapter/loyalty-to-the-company/"">Loyalty Research Company</a> (right?) defines loyal employees as “being committed to the success of the organization.&nbsp; They believe that working for this organization is their best option . . . and loyal employees do not actively search for alternative employment and are not responsive to offers.”&nbsp; And while we can debate the idea of moving on as being, at times, in the best interest of the employee so as to improve skills, widen job responsibilities and broaden industry knowledge, it’s the first portion of the definition that’s intriguing.</p> 
<p>Do your staff believe that working for the company is their best option?&nbsp; What a heart-of-the-matter question!&nbsp; It may be an option to work for this company, but is it the <em>best </em>option?&nbsp; Engagement as it relates to this is clear – are your folks connected to what the organization is doing, how they contribute to it and how they’re recognized for it?&nbsp; Loyalty is a commodity that companies desire, but don’t do much to cultivate.</p> 
<p>Think about how you set up the company to be the best option.&nbsp; Those performance reviews, appraisals, huddles, etc. should consist of content that drives considerations around the best that the company has to offer.&nbsp; For most, these times are reactive and responsive in nature.&nbsp; It’s problem or circumstance oriented.&nbsp; The view is downward.&nbsp; It focused on how we can handle what is happening right now and only right now. The “best” is never encouraged when you’re only looking down.&nbsp; Motivation towards the bigger picture is a clear path towards an understanding of ultimate success, fit and contribution.&nbsp; These are areas employees should understand well.</p> 
<p>Loyalty is then a by-product. We can work towards such devotion by allowing employees in to our plans and strategies.&nbsp; And as much as we clamor for transparency, it’s difficult for us to offer it.&nbsp; We are fearful that if we offer too much, we will compromise our managerial role or authority.&nbsp; Cultivate true partners, not merely robotic, subordinate do-ers.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> 
<p>The only robots that should be walking around your office is Twiki.&nbsp; And if you don’t know him…I just can’t. </p>

<!--more--><p>I listened to a dear colleague share how a fire ripped through the home of one of her staff, destroying everything.&nbsp; There is no longer a home to return to for that entire family.&nbsp; She shared how the company has banned together to make this a holiday of replenishment and affirmation like none other for the employee and her family.&nbsp; It’s awesome to hear how people can rise up to help.&nbsp; (It is, also, the post-holiday times that need to be handled as well.)</p> 
<p>Our role as managers, supervisors, executives, HR pros is to look around us.&nbsp; Tunnel vision on year-end deadlines and reporting is not helping the broader team.&nbsp; It’s work to get done, for sure, but the impact of those things may not be as helpful to the larger population.&nbsp; Look around and listen.</p> 
<p>Some areas of sensitivity:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li><strong>Military families</strong> – often, this time of year emphasizes the challenges of separation. Not having a particular family member home for the holidays can be painful.&nbsp; Do you know who might need some extra support or resources?&nbsp; How can you provide in a manner comfortable to the recipient?&nbsp; Not everyone wants to be videoed for a Facebook post…be aware of the employee’s tolerance for help and the way it’s delivered.</li> 
 <li><strong>Recently experiencing a family member’s departure</strong> – we will have employees who are currently dealing with the death of a close family member. The holidays might remind them of loss more than anything else.&nbsp; Are there support structures available through the company?&nbsp; EAP?&nbsp; Local counselors?&nbsp; And while it’s not so easy to broach the subject with some staff, being wise about the placement and opportunity for these resources is something we can do better.</li> 
 <li><strong>Loneliness</strong> – a general pang of loneliness sweeps over many in our organizations. Even if they’ve experienced death or relocation of family years ago, this time of year can still bring to the surface feelings of distance and despair.&nbsp; Look for ways to introduce small changes in workflow and schedules.&nbsp; That modest shake-up might be enough to introduce a new pattern of thought and response.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Of course, people are dealing with all sorts of personal issues that can affect work at any time of the year.&nbsp; But the holidays provide an especially sensitive time for some issues, often quite personal.&nbsp; Have eyes to see how you can be smartly sensitive, without being over-bearing or intrusive, to those around you and in your charge.&nbsp; And if you’re not sure how to handle it, talk to your HR team.&nbsp; Let them provide the expertise of thought, approach and response for you to use.</p> 
<p>Today, you might be the gift that someone needs. &nbsp;Don’t underestimate the impact you can have in the lives of others.&nbsp; By building healthy relationships, you can offer support and resources, but also a laugh and a cry.&nbsp; We’re all in the people business.</p>

<!--more--><p>While most of us won’t deal with those in such blatant disregard to our lead, we often find ourselves frustrated with a team that won’t “fall into line.”&nbsp; We have this unrealistic notion that people will do as we ask, or worse do as they should.&nbsp; Well, what should they do?&nbsp; Be?&nbsp; We’ve created the teams to function or to not function.&nbsp; We’ve delineated roles with duties, itemized performance and categorized priorities.&nbsp; Where are things falling apart?</p> 
<p>Let’s come back to that expectation.&nbsp; First, is it the right one to have?&nbsp; So much recruitment effort goes into finding the “right” person.&nbsp; We want someone who is a creative, skilled, cultural fit.&nbsp; We want someone who can bring new ideas and a fresh approach, but who does so in a comfortable way.&nbsp; We ask for independence and critical thinking, but also, need for them to follow our preferences.&nbsp; That would be difficult for anyone to live day in and day out.</p> 
<p>Often, the small points of employee performance become amplified because the expectations aren’t being met. &nbsp;We may not have done a great job of explaining those expectations, but we hold people accountable to those ideals, even if in conflict with one another.&nbsp; It’s our job to sit and to understand what this role should be about.&nbsp; Consider the tasks, the performance, the outcomes.&nbsp; What should those things look like?&nbsp; How would someone know that?&nbsp; And if you say, “job description”, then be prepared to actually read it to confirm.&nbsp; The static description might not speak to the dynamic punch you’re really looking for.</p> 
<p>The greatest level of difficulty comes when these expectations remain unspoken.&nbsp; Managers will say things like, “They just should know how to do their job.”&nbsp; Well, if you’re saying that, it’s because they aren’t.&nbsp; And if they aren’t, it’s because some resource or explanation is missing.&nbsp; And if that’s missing, it’s because you haven’t offered it. &nbsp;You can fix it.&nbsp; Don’t look at the people with disdain, but rather look at the situation and process.&nbsp; We assign labels to people too quickly and it digs a deeper hole for them to climb out of.&nbsp; It’s unfair and demands more effort than someone should be expected to give.</p> 
<p>Unspoken expectations and broken performance align regularly.&nbsp; It is a treatable situation.&nbsp; Usually, a trip back to the beginning of a person’s hiring helps.&nbsp; What was it about this person that made him/her our choice?&nbsp; Are those qualities being displayed now?&nbsp; Why not?&nbsp; From there, you can dissect the work to see if it meets the expectations of the role.&nbsp; Is there more happening in one area than another?&nbsp; Is that a surprise?&nbsp; Have resources been allocated to help?</p> 
<p>When you begin to ask questions like this, you demonstrate to employees the right kind of interaction and critical thought you desire from them.&nbsp; They may not have seen this kind of response happening to date.&nbsp; They are likely ready to respond similarly.&nbsp; Shockingly, they may begin to demonstrate the kind of communication and engagement you’ve been wanting to see after you walk through this.&nbsp; You will have set the tone.</p> 
<p>Now, when you walk into work each morning, you can have a healthy view of what the day will bring.&nbsp; Critical thinking rather than blind conformity.&nbsp; Cultural advancement rather than individual protection.&nbsp; It will be an environment where employees truly know what’s expected of them, and they are then happy to participate in the success of work.&nbsp; So different than the News Radio station of Dave Nelson.</p>

<!--more--><p>You see Stan was able to use his extraordinary power to allow us to see who superheroes &nbsp;really are.&nbsp; They have incredible strength but flawed characters.&nbsp; They receive throngs of praise but struggle with the demons at their heels.&nbsp; They believe in what might be but don’t see how they fit into the big picture.&nbsp; Stan held a mirror up to us but wrapped it in yellow spandex or muscle-bound green skin.</p> 
<p>As business and human resources professionals, we resemble these superheroes.&nbsp; We are the ones who champion a cause and lead the initiative.&nbsp; We are the ones who compose the message.&nbsp; We are consistent, reliable persons who show up when called.&nbsp; We rescue.&nbsp; And yet, we stumble, we doubt and we don’t always follow through well.&nbsp; We’re superheroes like any other.</p> 
<p>Part of the appeal of X-Men or the Avengers is not just that their powers come together to fight “bad guys,” but rather, to listen in to their dialogue and relational development.&nbsp; We watch them save the world, but they don’t know how to speak to one another.&nbsp; We observe their heroics in action, but we, also, see them struggle to save the relationships that matter most. &nbsp;Can’t we identify in some ways with these truths?</p> 
<p>Think about how many hours you’re spending at work.&nbsp; Is it fruitful?&nbsp; Does it accomplish something great?&nbsp; It certainly can, but do you spend time thinking about those efforts to ensure they do?&nbsp; It’s unwise to think that your heroics will mean rescue or solution just because you’re present.&nbsp; The plan of attack matters as much as the attack.&nbsp; Being deliberate with the resources you have in an effective manner is the stuff of superheroes, and you are one.</p> 
<p>And you can teach others around you how to better use their powers, too.&nbsp; Allow for some trial and error.&nbsp; Give people a chance to flex various muscles.&nbsp; And talk them through it.&nbsp; Let them know it’s not just the end performance that matters, but the path to get there, too.</p> 
<p>In Peter Parker, we see just such a person.&nbsp; A man seeking justice.&nbsp; A man broken by the death of his father figure.&nbsp; A man given extraordinary power.&nbsp; A man hiding who he fully is so he can be “normal.”&nbsp; He was a good kid.&nbsp; He did what was expected of him.&nbsp; He cared for his aunt.&nbsp; He was a good student.&nbsp; He was ready to help.&nbsp; What he didn’t know how to do was to use his gifts well, to trust those worthy of his trust and to account for alternative options.&nbsp; He needed to cultivate his critical thinking skills.&nbsp; We all have Peter Parker traits.</p> 
<p>Thank you, Stan Lee, for creating universes that cause us all to consider who we are and why we’re behaving as we are.&nbsp; Excelsior!</p>

<!--more--><p>It may be easy to see the champion when it’s someone who captivates a crowd.&nbsp; It may be easy to see the champion who puts in extra hours.&nbsp; For sure, we may need to shower those champions with gratitude, but we also, need to validate those who keep the need for a rescue to a minimum.&nbsp; Plotlines often demand conflict/problem and then someone to heal/correct.&nbsp; These heroes are seen as the champion of the story.</p> 
<p>And yet, most real stories need consistency in action and response.&nbsp; Think of the school teacher who shows up ready to invest in kids each day.&nbsp; Think of the administrative assistant who, in addition to core duties, ensures that meeting spaces and catering needs are handled quietly behind the scenes.&nbsp; Think of the manufacturing professional who enters each work daily with a quota and understated drive to meet it.&nbsp; These folks, too, are champions.</p> 
<p>Both of my grandmothers were waitresses for decades.&nbsp; They went into work, set tables, did kitchen prep, excelled in guest service, cultivated regulars, and were as reliable as the day is long.&nbsp; There were never big parties of appreciation for them at work.&nbsp; They did not get gold watches after 25 years of service.&nbsp; They were wired to be diligent, thoughtful and consistent.&nbsp; They were champions.</p> 
<p>It’s time to unmask these champions.&nbsp; Address each with thankfulness.&nbsp; Regale them with the effects of the work produced.&nbsp; Connect the dots for each by showing them how the ethic/performance qualities affect the larger picture of success.&nbsp; Even if you think they already know it, tell them again.</p> 
<p>Champions may grow tired of the underappreciation.&nbsp; They may feel that an organization has become expectant of their consistency in a demanding or non-considerate manner.&nbsp; It may be a “yeah, yeah, yeah” in response to the “you do know how valuable he/she/they are, right?”&nbsp; That dismissive, non-thoughtful answer or demeanor will not draw people to you.&nbsp; And certainly, it may move people far away from you.</p> 
<p>Recognition is a fundamental business value.&nbsp; It may take different paths in expression, but it’s a value that our staff expect.&nbsp; What have you done to show gratitude to those champions?&nbsp; Is it a gift card?&nbsp; Please.&nbsp; There’s nothing wrong with a gift card, but is that it?&nbsp; If that’s the biggest expression…well, you know.&nbsp; These champions bleed for the company, the team. &nbsp;Think about what type of gratitude expressions would be best.&nbsp; Knowing your people well will help you in knowing what to do next.</p> 
<p>And if you happen to feel like you’re a champion and no one takes the time to appreciate you, then let me say, “Good job.”&nbsp; I am grateful to have people like you in the mix.&nbsp; You are not overlooked by everyone.&nbsp; I count.</p>

<!--more--><p>In the upcoming movie, <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2126357/""><strong>Second Act</strong></a>, Jennifer Lopez plays a hard working 40-something woman who is full of street smarts but can’t get her foot in the door of some great companies with open opportunities that she’ll crush.&nbsp; That is until someone helps her with an entire new social media profile and history of experience (most of it untrue).&nbsp; She has the world open to her, but now she has to live as someone she isn’t in order to make it work.&nbsp; And herein is, also, the premise of many organizations in our country.</p> 
<p>We’ve decided that companies should function in “expansive and appealing” ways.&nbsp; We’ve introduced yoga, ping-pong and ax throwing.&nbsp; We’ve brought in nutritionists, horticulturists and phlebotomists.&nbsp; And while there is nothing wrong with options, is what’s being projected authentic?&nbsp; Is there alignment to the real culture versus the advertised culture?&nbsp; You know what they say about lipstick on a pig.</p> 
<p>Dig deep and figure out what makes your company special.&nbsp; That’s not to be trite or condescending, but rather to push the conversation towards core identity.&nbsp; What do we do?&nbsp; How do we do it?&nbsp; Why would customers come here rather than somewhere else?&nbsp; Is there a truth that current employees have to share about working here?&nbsp; These questions will get the conversation started with leadership, HR/TA and marketing.</p> 
<p>The “sell” of the company is part of the marketing effort that should be tied into recruitment and branding.&nbsp; It makes sense for marketing to be included in these discussions.&nbsp; Their expertise in crafting language and messaging is a skill that should be leveraged as we work on the appeal of our organizations.</p> 
<p>It will, also, take some training with hiring managers.&nbsp; They will need to know how to craft questions and responses in keeping with our core identity.&nbsp; Far too often, candidates interview with crabby, over-worked, tired hiring managers.&nbsp; Would you want to work for someone like that?&nbsp; I think not.&nbsp; Invest in messaging for the recruitment process.&nbsp; Give these managers tools they can use.</p> 
<p>One final thought: don’t apologize for what you do.&nbsp; Some areas of work are not sexy.&nbsp; It’s hard to make things look better than they really are.&nbsp; Although, Dice.com has done ads for finding “the hottest tech talent” with scantily clad hardware engineers; that’s creative (Google it).&nbsp; However, not every company can do that.&nbsp; Be unapologetic, but also be willing to craft a new approach to the realities of work at your organization.&nbsp; Give those job seekers a reason to find your company appealing.</p>

<!--more--><p>Living by opinion is a tough road to travel. &nbsp;In our workplaces, we have lots of people who are the product of this.&nbsp; Yes, we know that there are lots of pithy sayings that get posted about independence, not giving up the fight and a “screw you” attitude, but we know that it’s just not happening for everyone all the time (nor should it!).&nbsp; There are times that opinion can get us to think better, just as there are times that opinion will crash all around us and overwhelm.&nbsp; But in neither instance should we be living by the opinions of others.</p> 
<p>Some of our organizations might actually legislate by opinion.&nbsp; We’ve so believed the opinions of some that we have created structure around them.&nbsp; We institutionalize, and we belittle.&nbsp; Grand words, yes, but our constructs sometimes become mired in unity of thought rather than collaboration around idea, purpose and direction.&nbsp; Opinion can manipulate us into a response, even if it’s not one we would normally choose.</p> 
<p>Our ability to discern is a vital skill that we must handle well.&nbsp; It’s not as lost of an art form as some may believe, but it is harder to find.&nbsp; We should cultivate it.&nbsp; Have robust management conversations around process and purpose.&nbsp; Talk through the needs of people while balancing the function of the organization.&nbsp; These are tough talks, but it will allow us to discern the real needs of our teams and our work better without some of the noise of the loudest or most heard opinions.</p> 
<p>With people coming to work with various baggage around expectations, it’s important to set a tone regarding opinion.&nbsp; We value opinion, but opinion doesn’t make it so.&nbsp; Our ability to use opinions to create, reformulate, encourage to define process, purpose and function is our job.&nbsp; Don’t lose heart if it’s tough.&nbsp; Look for inroads with a few and start there.&nbsp; You certainly won’t be able to undo an entire organization’s dependence on wrong opinion overnight, but you will be able to run with those few to outline and highlight new data and information.</p> 
<p>Of course, there are organizations that are systemically bound to fear and the mandated opinions of a few.&nbsp; Those kinds of companies will be hard to change.&nbsp; It might not be worth the extended time you’ll have to spend fighting against it, and there’s no guarantee that it will work anyway.&nbsp; Cut your losses.</p> 
<p>The sins of the father don’t have to be your life sentence.&nbsp; The way you’ve learned to respond to those early opinion-bearing influences might not be completely healthy.&nbsp; Refine and reform those reactive areas and cultivate a right response in you first.&nbsp; And then take that to your teams!&nbsp; They will appreciate the help, at least in my opinion.</p>

<!--more--><p>While at #HRTechConf in Las Vegas this week, the challenge of approach to technology has been front and center.&nbsp; Our knee-jerk discernment path is usually to find something, plug it in and hope it make things better.&nbsp; When it doesn’t, we call the vendor and complain.&nbsp; We recall the demo and wonder why our experience is far from what we saw.&nbsp; We share our annoyance with our peers; we tweet out passive-aggressive faux-toughness.&nbsp; It’s frustrating for all.</p> 
<p>The Women in Technology portion of the HR Tech Conference is truly my favorite part, and this year did not disappoint.&nbsp; One of the panel discussions started with a basic fallacy of technology for work – having a current work process that you’d like to pepper with tech to make it better.&nbsp; At first, the thought made sense to me.&nbsp; I mean, that’s why we buy tech.&nbsp; We want a better flow, easier effort, and time to be returned to us.&nbsp; They’re not bad desires.</p> 
<p>When the Precogs from <u>Minority Report</u> have a gift (a technology) to tap into, lawmakers jump into action to add it to law enforcement.&nbsp; They saw the benefit it could bring and went for it.&nbsp; Without testing it fully, especially in areas of bias, as well as a lack of consideration around accountability, the process of enforcement became compromised.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because the technology was not meant to fit into the basic process already in place.&nbsp; It had the opportunity to enlarge it, to forge a new path, to approach problems differently.&nbsp; Process and technology are each independent but are meant to work interdependently.</p> 
<p>Gretchen Alarcon, from Oracle, drove this point home during the “AI, Blockchain and VR” session.&nbsp; When looking at technology, we must consider where the tech will take us.&nbsp; Countless initiatives fail because we want to season what we’re already doing with tech.&nbsp; And further, we miss out on the robust opportunities that technology might give us.&nbsp; We ought to have a macro view of it, even if the investigation starts with a micro-problem.</p> 
<p>In human resources, we tout ourselves as people developers.&nbsp; We do this by understanding our people, knowing what each can do and helping to forge a path of growth, application and advancement.&nbsp; Why should our approach to technology be any different?&nbsp; Good application should not be about what’s trending.&nbsp; Do you really need text recruiting technology?&nbsp; Do you have to have Snapchat for your brand?&nbsp; Do you need VR as part of your learning management system?&nbsp; Or do you want these things so you can say you have them?&nbsp; That does not sound very development-oriented.&nbsp; It sounds insecure.</p> 
<p>If you need technology for an issue at hand, look for it.&nbsp; But when you find it, consider all of what it is and how it’s meant to impact process, not merely fit into the process you have.&nbsp; And if you’re at the point where you have to pull your eyeballs out because of the technology you’ve put into place, it’s not too late to start again.&nbsp; Never take your eyeballs out.&nbsp; No tech is worth that.</p>

<!--more--><p>Celebration is part of the Labor Day tradition, as it should be, but there might be an uninvited guest joining you.&nbsp; Perhaps you already know who I am referring to…Regret.&nbsp; This week alone, I have spoken to no less than 4 people who shared what they had hoped to accomplish this summer and how far short they had come.&nbsp; Everyone of them remarked about how quickly the summer had gone, and how they couldn’t believe it.&nbsp; Time just flew by.</p> 
<p>Planning takes planning.&nbsp; What often gets us into trouble is biting off more than we can chew.&nbsp; While some of this is in public view – affecting co-workers, process improvements, or integration plans, for example – it isn’t only for all to see.&nbsp; We promise things to ourselves that we can’t deliver on.&nbsp; How many books can we read at once and actually retain the information?&nbsp; I am sure there are a few gifted folks who might be able to do that, but the vast majority cannot.&nbsp; We pile half a dozen books on our desks or nightstands with every intention of reading them all over a 10-week period.&nbsp; And then what happens? (cue the “whomp whomp” sound effect)</p> 
<p>Again, planning takes planning.&nbsp; We can have the very best of intentions (undoubtedly) but have poor execution.&nbsp; This disappoints others, but also, us.&nbsp; And that leads to guilt.&nbsp; About five years ago, Psychology Today published an article based on <a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-squeaky-wheel/201310/feeling-guilt-increases-our-subjective-body-weight"">embodied cognition</a> - a field of psychology that studies how our physical bodies impact thoughts, emotions, and perceptions – but used a mental state of guilt and disappointment and its effect on our physical bodies and our behavior.&nbsp; It is fascinating and showed how we can allow that state of mind to impact our view of self, even physically.&nbsp; It affects us to the core.</p> 
<p>And while not finishing your summer reading list might not cause you to become unglued, it might be a building block with some other well-intended, but unmet, promises, goals or aspirations.&nbsp; Have you found yourself in a pattern of over-promising (even to self) but under-delivering?</p> 
<p>Maybe the summer’s end doesn’t have to be such a cruel reminder of all that you didn’t do.&nbsp; Maybe instead, it can be a time to encourage better consideration for your time and your commitments.&nbsp; Maybe you can re-assess your timelines around certain promises and projects.&nbsp; As professionals, we ought to evaluate our responsiveness, our completion timelines and the actual effectiveness versus intended effectiveness.&nbsp; Is the time we have able to be committed well to get the results needed?&nbsp; It will vary from goal to goal, but the process of consideration ahead of commitment based upon previous experiences will set you up for guilt-free success.</p> 
<p>Oh, and about that cooking class you were going to take this summer…there’s always the fall.</p>

Nope.</p> 
<!--more--><p><strong>Communication</strong> – An underestimated value of HR is the ability to bring healthy communication to the forefront.&nbsp; Change management, conflict management, organizational development, training, employee discipline, onboarding (do I need to go on?) …all require great communication.&nbsp; Human Resources sits as a hub of communication.&nbsp; As professionals we have to take that responsibility seriously and put the time into crafting the verbiage necessary for the situation.&nbsp; Using the same templated approach might not work any longer.&nbsp; Endeavor to make words matter, explain, heal and encourage.</p> 
<p><strong>Competency Alignment</strong> – Check your folks.&nbsp; Who is where?&nbsp; Why are they there?&nbsp; Establishing an understanding of needed skills and aptitudes for each role and then ensuring those doing the work can is vital to HR.&nbsp; We plug the hole so often that we have belittled the value of the role.&nbsp; Each person has abilities.&nbsp; Our job is to make sure they are aligning with the company’s needs and mission.&nbsp; Test, assess and alter pathways.&nbsp; Our organizations are organisms; they are alive, and we have to adjust to environmental changes, business viability strategies and technological advancements.&nbsp; Our people may not see what’s coming, but we should.</p> 
<p><strong>Courage</strong> – Human Resources can be the catalyst to some great changes and movements.&nbsp; This isn’t merely for the sake of the latest and greatest cause, but rather for the health of people and companies.&nbsp; We’re going to need to have tough conversations with leadership, with line-level employees, with vendors, with government, with any area that impacts the work to be done and the influence it’s meant to have.&nbsp; And ask when you don’t know something.&nbsp; Bravery is not stupidity.&nbsp; Pretending to be something you’re are not substantially weakens your ability to have an impact at work.&nbsp; Trust is broken and confidence is shaken.&nbsp; Get the assistance you need, rally a team around you, and bravely push for the best and right next steps.</p> 
<p><strong>Creativity</strong> – Don’t stop innovating.&nbsp; That’s a daily discipline.&nbsp; Human Resources is a funnel for information, problems, people and processes.&nbsp; Pull them together and cultivate a vision for how to best use them all.&nbsp; Our ability to dream and to experiment is something our organizations need us to do, even if they aren’t asking us to do it.&nbsp; The viewpoint we have must be added to the mix of perspectives for leadership.&nbsp; We might not always win every battle, but we influence the war.&nbsp; Innovation changes circumstances, reflects culture and transforms individuals.</p> 
<p>And while there are subsets and asterisks to apply to these areas, digest what’s here first.&nbsp; Human Resources is a large endeavor and responsibility.&nbsp; To be taken more seriously, we need to pursue relentlessly the best approaches, information and teaching for developmental purposes. &nbsp;HR can be better each day by applying effort in each of these areas.&nbsp; Keep this recipe card in hand and gather the ingredients you need.&nbsp; You’re the Top Chef in your organizations so work that kitchen!</p>

Unfortunately, I’m not speaking of the type of critical that has to do with thought or strategy.&nbsp; The reference is to the criticism that we, as a people, are so easily drawn to.&nbsp; It’s not a new phenomenon.&nbsp; And with social media readily available, we have sat back and judged what’s around us through a lens of self until it’s become, well, an art form.</p> 
<!--more--><p>Judgment is a necessary function of our lives.&nbsp; As a father of three, I want my children to discern who they hang out with, what kinds of activities they spend time on and what future they want.&nbsp; That must have a level of judgment to it.&nbsp; “Don’t judge” is a phrase that’s held in high regard by some, but I don’t think the phrase is a universally applicable command.&nbsp; I have taught my kids to judge, and I stand by it.</p> 
<p>But, what about the ease of criticism that plagues us?&nbsp; Is that the type of universal judgment that we should encourage?</p> 
<p>In the world of human resources, we are often the ones who broker relationships.&nbsp; We deal in understanding, communication and reconciliation to achieve a goal.&nbsp; We massage (no real touching, please!), we confront, we mediate.&nbsp; Consideration is one of our tools in these endeavors.&nbsp; We ask an individual to consider the perspective of the business or of the leaders of the business.&nbsp; We ask if it’s possible that what an individual sees isn’t all there is to know.&nbsp; And we’re right to do so.</p> 
<p>My family is obsessed with <u>The Bachelor/Bachelorette</u> franchise.&nbsp; They plan their schedules to ensure that Monday nights are protected.&nbsp; And when they sit together to watch, they enjoy the process of someone finding a “life-long” mate.&nbsp; And then Dad joins them on occasion.&nbsp; I’m usually allowed to sit for about 10 minutes before the excommunication proceedings begin.&nbsp; I judge everything happening on screen. I mock some of the participants.&nbsp; I roll my eyes.&nbsp; I feign puking.&nbsp; I am snarking about it all.&nbsp; And then I am removed from the premises.</p> 
<p>Honestly, I have a large group of people who would support me in my criticalness.&nbsp; I mean, how many couples work out from this show?&nbsp; I have metrics, people!&nbsp; But what I know I do is move from judging the premise of the show to the judging the participants.&nbsp; It’s so easy to segue into.&nbsp; I don’t have to think about it much.&nbsp; It’s a gift, I know.</p> 
<p>Haven’t you had to talk people off the ledge?&nbsp; They come to you with a situation that evolves into rumor and baseless accusation towards another.&nbsp; You jump in to say, “Wait, how do you know that?”&nbsp; They may answer with things like, “Well, what else could it be?” “That’s what I have heard” or “Don’t you remember what happened three years ago?”&nbsp; You affirm that the person might be stringing a line of thought together that is missing some information.&nbsp; I know that I have had to ask employees, “Well, tell me what the President said to you when you discussed this.”&nbsp; Often, the employee looks at me puzzled and responds, “We didn’t discuss this.”&nbsp; And my point gets made and I get to spend a few minutes planning out a better approach to the frustration and to move away from judgment of the person.</p> 
<p>Think about the last few situations that you’ve been through at work.&nbsp; How quickly did you move from judging the situation to judging a person?&nbsp; The situation may require you to offer judgment to a person, in the form of some discipline surrounding the behavior.&nbsp; That’s not what I mean.&nbsp; Think about the characterization that might be slipping into your mind.&nbsp; Consider the bias it might give you towards the situation.&nbsp; Think about the dots you are choosing to connect based upon assumption, annoyance or attitude.&nbsp; Are you judging in the wrong way?</p> 
<p>Sitting with CEOs, I often hear how certain members of their organization cannot get beyond a characterization regarding that leader.&nbsp; One CEO shared that he had absolutely messed up in an approach to a business relationship about 10 years ago and the HR Director, who had been there for more than the past 10 years, is still critical towards him.&nbsp; She won’t let him forget or consider that he’s grown from it.&nbsp; It’s a box and he’s in it.</p> 
<p>Do I think that <u>The Bachelor</u> police are coming to get me for my harsh criticism? &nbsp;Nope.&nbsp; That won’t really affect my day-to-day living (other than it being a pleasant way to pass a few minutes).&nbsp; But, when each of us chooses to move into personal judgment and criticism without knowing all the facts or details in real-life situations, we do so to our own as well as the company’s detriment.</p>

Isn’t it the norm to see beautiful people loving their lives in the website shots of most companies?&nbsp; As I have been helping with a not-for-profit website, I have gotten to look at a bunch of stock pictures.&nbsp; They’re all so pretty.</p> 
<!--more--><p>Is it pretty at work?&nbsp; I mean, I appreciate a good-looking crowd, but I don’t think that’s how it is at most places.&nbsp; I think that there are some ugly things that go on and the crowd that we have at work might be taking on the strains. &nbsp;The stress of a manager that has gone unchecked for years because he/she brings in lots of sales or has strong relationships in the industry despite being toxic to the subordinate staff leaves a mark, or a bruise, or permanent damage.&nbsp; Or the executive that thinks he/she has a collaborative culture but that really means that everyone has to agree with the lousy ideas he/she brings up.</p> 
<p>There is a conversation happening amongst the team at work.&nbsp; They, too, look at the website and think, “Who are these people?”&nbsp; They want to know how to make sense of those people in light of the truth they experience.&nbsp; It’s incongruous.</p> 
<p>Is the answer to have no stock photos on the site?&nbsp; Or to only use photographs of the unhappy people working at the organization?&nbsp; Of course not.&nbsp; But rather, the answer should be to address the disconnect between the site and the reality.</p> 
<p>First off, it’s not that the website is the be-all and end-all.&nbsp; It’s representative of a potential problem.&nbsp; Of course, there is a marketing purpose to the site.&nbsp; It has to look attractive.&nbsp; It is meant to appeal to an audience who will buy the product or service.&nbsp; Got it.&nbsp; The site, however, projects what a company either thinks it is or wants to be.&nbsp; Employees, as well, will see those nuanced messages.&nbsp; They will decide on the validity of it all.&nbsp; And while some may not care about the website, the inconsistencies in messaging will be lunchroom fodder.</p> 
<p>And then think about the intra-office orientation.&nbsp; You know, the one where the seasoned staff given the skinny on how things really are at the company to those newbies with high ideals and excitement about where they’ve come to work.&nbsp; And in about two weeks, those newbies have started to matriculate to the poor attitude and true company culture of those more-tenured staff.</p> 
<p>Then pepper in the HR team who seem to live in a bubble of happy team-building and silly programs about fish, and there you have the makings of a disjointed culture.&nbsp; Executives are fed a line from the senior management about the latest surveys and engagement results while the staff are laughing at our lack of connection to reality.&nbsp; We need to wake up.</p> 
<p>This isn’t negative.&nbsp; On the contrary, it’s very positive.&nbsp; We can have fluid, realistic impact on our teams.&nbsp; It takes a commitment to communication and change.&nbsp; Easy, right?&nbsp; It’s not, but it is one where our time should be spent.&nbsp; We need to be relevant to the business and we need to align idealism to reality.&nbsp; If our company is not like the stock photos on the site, then address it.&nbsp; Don’t hide.&nbsp; It’s okay to have a dialogue about marketing while talking about culture.&nbsp; Fix culture.&nbsp; Ask staff what’s really going on.&nbsp; And then do something about it.</p> 
<p>Pretty people aren’t the problem.&nbsp; Inconsistencies and disjointed culture are. &nbsp;Executives, leadership, managers…whoever they are, have them start these conversations.&nbsp; And have them often.</p>

<!--more--><p>With the rampant advent of HR groups on SoMe over the last 5-8 years, it’s also a chance for people to meet each other IRL (in real life…in case you don’t speak acronym).&nbsp; It’s truly remarkable to see people catch up who have “known” each other online but have never been in each other’s physical company.&nbsp; The genuine joy and love are palpable.&nbsp; Meeting each other in person solidifies the relationship that’s already been defined by ideals, thoughts, perspectives and truths shared through the online vehicle.</p> 
<p>During the SHRM Conference, Mary Faulkner from Denver Water encouraged HR folks to get out of their office and “mix and mingle” during her presentation. &nbsp;And while this advice is spot on, I found it to be applicable to a consideration around diversity and inclusion.&nbsp; It’s a physical commitment, but also a mental one.&nbsp; Our ideals and thoughts might have validity, but are we willing to mix and mingle with others’ considerations?&nbsp; Listening and considering does not mean that everyone will agree, but it does mean that we will understand deeper why we think what we think.&nbsp; And for those opinions that are challenged and changed, isn’t that a great mark of inclusive thought?&nbsp; We have not cornered the market on finalized thoughts and considerations.&nbsp; Convictions are one thing, but exposure is another.</p> 
<p>Herein lies part of the answer to our diversity and inclusion problem at work.&nbsp; When we first meet our co-workers, teammates and managers, it’s in person.&nbsp; We do the scan up and down (don’t say you don’t, you do) and our brains categorize this person.&nbsp; We base on those visual cues – dress, grooming, style, looks.&nbsp; Subconsciously, we label and we presume.&nbsp; Understand that it’s not necessarily negative, but we do it without much conscious thought.</p> 
<p>Moving forward, any of those thoughts, perspectives and ideas that this person shares are filtered through that lens.&nbsp; We take more or less seriously those words, and we take action, if any, accordingly.&nbsp; And despite having a variety of people groups in our organizations, we don’t necessarily approach each other bias-free.&nbsp; We see, we categorize and we assume.&nbsp; Diversity of type does not mean diversity of thought.&nbsp; We may then back away from opportunities to be exposed to different thinking and process considerations.</p> 
<p>While I am aware of the ability to read feeds for an individual on SoMe outlets, it is different than having the person directly in front of you from the start.&nbsp; Our relationship is based upon what they share, present and believe.&nbsp; There is no real distraction based on physical appearance or assumed financial status.&nbsp; And though I may not agree with the full perspective presented, very rarely am I left feeling as though I am belittling them in my mind.&nbsp; Usually our negative perspectives come from what we hear in light of what we see in person.&nbsp; We don’t have that same encumbrance online.</p> 
<p>Each of us can consider the perspective of another.&nbsp; We can dialogue about the influences that have led us to where we are today.&nbsp; We can appreciate the path of others more.&nbsp; And our diversity of numbers becomes more about its intended diversity of approach and experience.&nbsp; And our openness to the variety of representation strengthens the likelihood that we’ll really hear a wider perspective.</p> 
<p>Understand that the challenge isn’t to only be friends with people online (heaven forbid!), but to take some of the best we have acclimated to in our rapport development and apply it to another collaborative and relational outlet.&nbsp; Our workplaces are not only ideal for this type of engagement, but our companies need the business advantage of diverse and inclusive thought and application.&nbsp; As Mary said, mix and mingle.</p>

I had to schedule an appointment (three times).&nbsp; The technician who attended was able to fix the issue and get everything back up.&nbsp; He was not aware of my demand for immediate action and he did not seem motivated upon learning that. He did his job and that was it.</p> 
<!--more--><p>Business owners and managers who demand respect are often surprised by the failure of others to respond to it.&nbsp; They may be shocked, actually, by the sheer insolence demonstrated by staff.</p> 
<p>And before you think to offer to me, “Well, they should know that if you want respect, you have to give respect,” consider that most of them know this.&nbsp; These business owners or managers were once subordinate employees, too, and felt that same need for two-way respect.&nbsp; But somehow, once there is a supervisory role offered, time changes their perspective. Why?</p> 
<p>Comparison, for starters. &nbsp;Supervisors look to how they acted when dealing with their managers and project that onto the current staff being led.&nbsp; This is problematic for a couple of reasons.&nbsp; First off, it’s unlikely that those rose-colored glasses you are looking through are giving you the right, full memories of your time in the cubicles or on the floor.&nbsp; Were you really that angelic towards your manager? You were a model of respect for that supervisor? Really?&nbsp; We tend to remember the best highlights and then use that as the base comparison tool when looking at our team.&nbsp; It sets them up to fail.</p> 
<p>And secondly, that comparison is based upon your view of respect.&nbsp; The definition for respect is often one based on child-rearing and authorities in life.&nbsp; Think about how manners and politeness are used interchangeably with respect.&nbsp; While I try to hold a door open for a woman coming into or exiting a room, is that really the same as respecting her?&nbsp; My surface behavior may have been respectful, but nothing more than that.&nbsp; Respect is meant to be deeper than that.&nbsp; And it cannot be based simply upon colloquial definitions and adherence to polite societal norms.</p> 
<p>Respect is living and breathing.&nbsp; It is something that has to be fed, cultivated and pruned.&nbsp; Demanding it would be like planting a seed and yelling at it to grow now.&nbsp; Even the best farmers cannot get seeds to grow that way.&nbsp; Similarly, for an owner or manager to stand before his/her charges and demand the same is foolishness.</p> 
<p>A company that’s been around for 10 years with an owner who is a jerk is not likely to see a staff that genuinely respects its owner.&nbsp; Time does not predict respect either.</p> 
<p>Those in Human Resources often find themselves holding the short end of the stick when it comes to perceived respect.&nbsp; We are the department avoided, the last to know a significant piece of information or overlooked for career advancement within our organizations because sales and other operations-based departments are seen as more relevant of attention.&nbsp; Is that a lack of respect due to manners or politeness? Or is it more about the demonstration of respect given and exercised?</p> 
<p>Yes, respect is earned, but it’s earned based upon a demonstration of involvement.&nbsp; And if you’re really doing that, stay the course.&nbsp; Today might not give you the win, but the win is coming.&nbsp; Involvement in the mission, investment in others and a willingness to put effort into results will set a right tone of respect.&nbsp; Demanding it is the simplest way to not be shown it; demonstrating it consistently will secure its offering to you.</p>

<!--more--><p>To be certain, it probably does feel like forever.&nbsp; You’ve engaged, you’ve communicated, you’ve tried.&nbsp; What more could someone want from you to know that you’re serious about influencing change, change for the betterment of others, of product, of service, of self?</p> 
<p>Perhaps today, it needs to be about tactic.</p> 
<p>If you remember <u>M*A*S*H</u>, then you’ll recall Klinger.&nbsp; Klinger spent season after season on the show trying to get sent home.&nbsp; He didn’t want to be serving in the military; he wanted to be home.&nbsp; To that end, he chose to dress as a woman.&nbsp; Now remember, this show was set during the Korean Conflict.&nbsp; Klinger would wear dresses, stockings, heels (definitely not standard issue uniform!) in order to be seen as mentally unstable, and therefore, needing to be sent home.&nbsp; The Colonel understood his tactic and wouldn’t budge.&nbsp; If Klinger wanted to wear heels, then so be it, just as long as he could run a mile warm up in the morning in those shoes.&nbsp; Klinger’s tactic didn’t work, and he remained at the 4077<sup>th</sup> until the end of the war.</p> 
<p>As time progressed, Klinger stopped wearing those outfits and wore the standard uniform.&nbsp; He accepted the reality that he was staying in the war.&nbsp; He then directed his attentions to make his time (and the time of his team) more bearable.&nbsp; He changed his tactics due to a mindset switch.</p> 
<p>Whether you are a line-level employee or a CEO, your mindset might need a switch.&nbsp; Your frustration with what hasn’t changed might be valid, but how have you been trying to change it?&nbsp; If it’s not working, go back to the drawing board.&nbsp; Do you need to accept the reality and focus more on how to incorporate it into your routine of existence?&nbsp; Or do you need to travel a new path to highlight the necessity for a cultural, process or system change?&nbsp; We have all heard the definition of insanity, but why do so many of us fall victim to it?</p> 
<p>And as a quick consideration, if you are a receiver of others’ thoughts around change, please listen.&nbsp; Listening is not the same as adoption.&nbsp; You can listen well and disagree.&nbsp; Offer reasons for your team to understand why things are the way they are.&nbsp; Don’t apologize but don’t be inconsiderate.</p> 
<p>And if you’re the offeror of change thoughts, and those thoughts are heard and responded to, the ability to accept the results is a skill to learn and embrace.&nbsp; Start by discerning that you have been heard.&nbsp; There is a difference between being heard and getting what you want.&nbsp; It is easy to allow the emotion of disappointment to mess with validating communication.&nbsp; They should be two different considerations.</p> 
<p>So, let’s change today.&nbsp; Select a different workout regime.&nbsp; Look differently at your significant other, your children, your parents.&nbsp; Approach co-workers with a new communication plan.&nbsp; Enacting change takes variety – thought, process, measurement.&nbsp; If it were easy, we’d all do it right, right?</p>

<!--more--><p>When Joyce took leave to take care of Will, she didn’t do so excitedly.&nbsp; She let her boss know that her son was ill, and they weren’t sure what was wrong with him or how long she’d be out.&nbsp; Her boss didn’t know what to say to her, but just let her do her own thing (I don’t really think Joyce was asking his permission). &nbsp;The reality was that Will was having issues with the Upside-Down and his body was invaded by the Demogorgon.&nbsp; I mean, does that sound like vacation to you?</p> 
<p>People have needs.&nbsp; There is no escaping that.&nbsp; Whether it’s the arrival of a baby or the unexpected journey of disease, our staff will likely have something affect them.&nbsp; And very often, the management involved is sympathetic to the issues.&nbsp; And then there are those who seem to ruin it all…</p> 
<p>Yes, I know there are apps available that track your eligibility for FMLA usage.&nbsp; Yes, I know there are some unions who have used leave laws as a squeeze tactic in renegotiations.&nbsp; Yes, I know that there are “doctors” who do their discipline a disservice by mass-marketing excuse-from-work documents.&nbsp; I know. It ticks me off as well.</p> 
<p>The first consideration to keep in mind constantly is that those bad apples are not the majority.&nbsp; Those having babies, surgeries or caring for someone are not eager to be without work and pay.&nbsp; It’s not unusual for an employee upon getting back to work to share how much he/she needed to get back.&nbsp; Work can be a healthy outlet and distraction from the health difficulties at home.&nbsp; A little bit of an escape is helpful.&nbsp; Those people are not your problems, so don’t legislate against them.</p> 
<p>And secondly, FMLA is job protection, not income protection. &nbsp;Staff who take right advantage of this leave are not doing so for extra paid time off.&nbsp; Often, their needs surpass any concurrent vacation time payout.&nbsp; And while some states have paid leave options, they don’t last the full 12 weeks of FMLA available, and that pay is a fraction of what they might normally make.&nbsp; It’s a stressor and most can’t wait to get back to work to earn full pay.</p> 
<p>But thirdly, it’s important to document and follow a consistent process in leave requests and management.&nbsp; An employer has a right to have federal and/or state documentation completed as part of the leave request.&nbsp; An employer should use its HR department well here.&nbsp; The cause is not protecting the employer or protecting the employee; it is both.&nbsp; Allow HR to have great clarity around the process and expectations with management, and then to express the same transparency in process to the employee.&nbsp; Communication is a great weapon here.</p> 
<p>Of course, legal counsel is helpful when it gets to the point of problem.&nbsp; If someone cannot return after 12 weeks of FMLA and is extended another 30 or 60 days under ADA, there is a reasonableness that must be considered.&nbsp; Counsel can often help with this.</p> 
<p>Just remember that not every employee is a jerk.&nbsp; There are some, for sure, but not the majority.&nbsp; Maintaining tight process, inclusive of an independent medical examination when needed, will make it less likely that someone will try to circumvent.</p> 
<p>It’s in our best interest to provide leave of some kind to our employees.&nbsp; It’s a benefit of employment, as much as it’s a rule of law.&nbsp; We hire people.&nbsp; And people, including you, face circumstances that are not always in our control.&nbsp; Lay aside the defensive posture at the onset and lead with compassionate consideration.</p>

<!--more--><p>What stories do you have to tell?</p> 
<p>There of those of us who have a story for everything.&nbsp; We’re naturally inclined to highlight a point by recalling an experience in great detail.&nbsp; Our minds are nostalgic rolodexes filled with “I remember once’s.”&nbsp; It’s easy for us to recall, relate and remind others.</p> 
<p>But for some of us, it’s not so easy.&nbsp; We struggle to come up with the right response at the right moment.&nbsp; And by the time we do think of a great story, the moment has long passed.&nbsp; Like George Costanza on Seinfield.&nbsp; You remember, right?&nbsp; A co-worker Riley, upon seeing George scarfing down shrimp said, “Hey George, the ocean called.&nbsp; They’re running out of shrimp.”&nbsp; The rest of his team laughed at his expense and he couldn’t think of a comeback.&nbsp; And when he did think of something, he tried to make it work days later, and of course, it fell flat.&nbsp; We’re afraid of the same thing.</p> 
<p>When it comes to examples and stories, you’ve got a longer window to come back to people.&nbsp; Your intention is not to humiliate (sorry, George), but rather to illuminate.&nbsp; It’s okay to return back to someone a day or two later, and say, “Hey, remember when we were talking about the EEO?&nbsp; I thought of something that happened to me that I wanted to share.”&nbsp; And then move into that sharing.</p> 
<p>For both kinds of storytellers, here’s a few helpful hints:</p> 
<p>1 – <strong>Know the point of your story before you start.&nbsp;</strong> You might be so excited to tell this really funny story that you put your energy into the delivery rather than in the lesson or consideration.&nbsp; People will remember the story, but likely have a hard time remembering the product.&nbsp; We’ve seen this with television advertising, right?&nbsp; Hilarious commercial, but what was it for again?</p> 
<p>2 – <strong>Be concise.</strong>&nbsp; Most people don’t have time for a 20-minute diatribe on the misgivings you have around non-monetary compensation taxation.&nbsp; Keep the example brief, but poignant or memorable.&nbsp; Repeat the point twice during the story (not in a row, but as a matter of discourse).</p> 
<p>3 – <strong>Focus the attention on the takeaway not on the deliverer.</strong>&nbsp; We all love to talk about ourselves, I get it, but if this is to be a learning opportunity, then keep it as such.&nbsp; If we’re approaching the “stage” in our minds as we share, then we’re likely to make it about us.&nbsp; Again, point 1 – know the point of your story, but also maintain that as your directive in sharing.</p> 
<p>We all have things to share.&nbsp; Yes, even those reading this thinking, “I don’t have any good stories,” you do!&nbsp; HR and management work gives us stories daily!&nbsp; Yes, you will need to change names to protect identities.&nbsp; Perhaps you’ll need to speak a bit abstractly.&nbsp; But you have stories.&nbsp; Take the time to categorize a few and be ready to share when the time comes.</p> 
<p>Storytelling is as old as human existence.&nbsp; Take care in handling them.&nbsp; Respect the knowledge passed down and the contributions you’ll be making.&nbsp; Encourage the hearers of your examples to consider a different option, to open the door to a new process and to welcome robust, healthy communication.&nbsp; It’s your gift of experience to treat respectfully and to offer willingly.</p> 
<p>No one wants to be the jerk that gets a call from the jerk store.</p>

<!--more--><p>Somewhere in the midst of our drive towards culture advancement and attention, we may have signed up our managers to be counselors and buddies.&nbsp; In order to provide a healthy environment, managers may have been cornered into being friends with their team.&nbsp; Is that okay?</p> 
<p>Think about some of our initiatives – open door policies, open workspaces, open communication, corporate transparency.&nbsp; Could they have an unintended consequence of “relational dive”?&nbsp; Relational dive is the act of moving deeply with another at a quick clip.&nbsp; In this context, it may be better described as a forced relational dive.&nbsp; If a consequence of our team building and culture push is to put leadership in a position to be diving deeply with staff, are we ready for that?&nbsp; Are those managers?</p> 
<p>From a consideration standpoint, it should be noted that those initiatives mentioned are not problematic in and of themselves.&nbsp; There has been some great advancement in talent management, specifically retention, succession planning and skill development, due to these initiatives.&nbsp; The culture where you are may have been healthily infused with enthusiasm, cooperation and creativity as a result.&nbsp; Keep it going!</p> 
<p>And yet, there still can be consequences that we did not plan for or consider.&nbsp; Forced friendship may be one in this case.</p> 
<p>In the past month, I have heard from quite a few managers who are feeling as though their job requires them to be friends with their team.&nbsp; They’ve been made to feel this way, in large part, due to the thinking that good culture is full of camaraderie, team-building and warmth, which feels like friendship.&nbsp; They, also, don’t want to be the department with turnover issues or, worse, poor 360 feedback.</p> 
<p>We may have made the line too definitive.&nbsp; Either you’re liked or not.&nbsp; Not being liked is always a problem.&nbsp; Therefore, the manager must be the problem.&nbsp; But a manager has to enforce structure, policy and rule, too, in order to get work done.&nbsp; It’s not his/her fault the “bad guy/girl” enforcement has to happen at times.&nbsp; And because we’ve made the manager be a friend, it damages the “friendship” because authority is inserted.</p> 
<p>I have read subordinate reviews of managers where they tear apart this person as unyielding, a dictator and not good with people.&nbsp; And upon examination into those details, some of those managers were addressing lateness and absence issues, poor work product production and failing to meet corporate standards for the position.&nbsp; When we set managers up to be friends, these addressed issues are no longer work-related, but extremely personal.&nbsp; How could a friend treat me like that?</p> 
<p>Admittedly, there is nothing wrong with finding a friend or two along your career journey.&nbsp; That’s the blessing of working with so many people.&nbsp; You’re bound to find someone who shares interests, humor, beliefs, etc. and with whom you can really talk.&nbsp; That’s a joy!&nbsp; Embrace those few opportunities.&nbsp; But the reality is, not everyone you work with is going to be your friend.</p> 
<p>In a world of Facebook “friends”, we’ve watered down that word considerably. It’s ideal that managers (all staff for that matter) be friendly to those around them.&nbsp; There most certainly is a difference, however, between being friendly and being friends.&nbsp; Some companies are struggling with the difference here and, as such, have confused it for their managers.&nbsp; Managers should be should be good listeners, but not counselors.&nbsp; Managers should be good project planners, but not enablers.&nbsp; Managers should be warm and inviting, but not doormats. &nbsp;And many of these tensions come out of a desire for great culture.</p> 
<p>Forced friendship is not genuine culture.&nbsp; It’s merely a feeling, and experience tells us that basing anything on feelings only is a setup to fail.</p> 
<p>It’s understandable to want a robust, collaborative community.&nbsp; Go for it!&nbsp; Just look at how managers are being told, whether in words or not, to carry that out and at what tools you’ve given them.</p> 
<p>Managers should not be the Alice-archetype of a busybody, but we, also, don’t want to exasperate them so much that they move into the Flo-archetype of “kiss my grits,” no matter how much we might want to say that to some.</p>

<!--more--><p>While at WorkHuman in Austin, one of my distinct pleasures was hearing Brene Brown live and in person.&nbsp; She was wonderfully approachable and clearly focused. &nbsp;Her message resonated with the audience, in large part due to her attention to courage.&nbsp; Brene challenged our considerations between vulnerability and bravery.&nbsp; She asked, “Think about a time when you observed bravery. Was risk involved?”&nbsp; Of course.&nbsp; “Is risk vulnerable?” Yup.&nbsp; So why categorize bravery as separate from vulnerability?</p> 
<p>Many guys are taught that vulnerability is weakness.&nbsp; Why would that be weakness?&nbsp; Brene spoke to major league sports teams who struggled to think of examples of courage without vulnerability.&nbsp; They could not.&nbsp; They recognized that being brave is conviction-based, values-aware, but still extremely exposed to risk.&nbsp; Strength is found in the ability to handle that vulnerability and risk as a matter of course.&nbsp; Sometimes, it’s in the silence that our vulnerability is most raw, but our bravery is most activated.</p> 
<p>My son is brave.&nbsp; For 6 years, he suffered with scoliosis.&nbsp; He wore a hard back brace for over 5 years.&nbsp; He had two surgeries to repair his back – a Chiari malformation in his neck and rod insertion to correct his spine – which took two summers of his high school life.&nbsp; He learned to walk with a new gait.&nbsp; He spent hours in pain and just willed himself through it.&nbsp; He let me see him at his most vulnerable, and I find him to be one of the most courageous people I have ever known.</p> 
<p>We don’t need to wait for something medical or life-threatening. &nbsp;I know that many leaders struggle with the right level of vulnerability.&nbsp; How much should I share?&nbsp; How might I seem too weak to my staff if I am constantly asking for feedback?&nbsp; How will my team feel empowered if I come across as unsure?</p> 
<p>Courage is inspiring.&nbsp; And if that courage comes with some vulnerability, as it will, then that’s okay.&nbsp; A look of fear or a tear in the eye aren’t enough to undo your role.&nbsp; Facing those fears head-on, owning the uncertainty and being fueled by the pain make us brave.&nbsp; And bravery will rally people.</p>

<!--more-->
<p>Routine isn’t all bad and it is often quite reassuring when other areas of life start to get off-track.&nbsp; The security of knowing what you have to do might be all you can hang your hat on today. &nbsp;Repetition is the great learning equalizer.&nbsp; Practice provides the opportunity for consistency and mastery of a skill or process.&nbsp; Doing it over and over can settle in a great sense of accomplishment.</p>
<p>And yet, don’t assume that lifelong repetition will be enough for all.&nbsp; Boredom can set in.&nbsp; The ho-hum of life is not a strategy.</p>
<p>In the workplace, boredom can lead to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turnover</li>
<li>Safety violations</li>
<li>Unproductivity</li>
<li>Inefficiency</li>
<li>Selfishness</li>
<li>Insubordination/Disrespect</li>
</ul>
<p>None of these points are attractive to an employer.&nbsp; Think about it this way: would you hire the person who is currently struggling with the boredom and non-challenging role if you were interviewing him/her for the first time?&nbsp; That demeanor and lack of enthusiasm would likely not excite you too much!&nbsp; And yet, we will pay millions across our workforce for unengaged employees (see <a href=""/shes-not-there"" rel=""noopener"">“She’s Not There”</a>).&nbsp; It is something we need to shake up.</p>
<p>Cross-training provides one strategy to deal with the boredom.&nbsp; What would it do to your organization to have people functionally literate in other areas of a project, of the process, or of the business?&nbsp; Of course, there are functional benefits to such a strategy (covering vacations, PTO), but it’s also strategic in the overall engagement and business progression plan.&nbsp; Rarely do I hear that organizations have too much talent who are poised for cross-functional projects and new verticals.</p>
<p>A deeper dive with the master of a singular process is another strategy.&nbsp; It’s not unusual for the very people who know the most about production, process or delivery to be overlooked in any efficiency or expansion conversation.&nbsp; The leadership might have 8-10 meetings about such changes, with only one happening with the front line of defense.&nbsp; Why not capture that body of knowledge sooner and more often? &nbsp;Buy-in is a natural by-product of knowledge-share.</p>
<p>When Roseanne was asked her opinion at the manufacturing facility or the restaurant or one of the other jobs she had, she perked up and became engaged (albeit flavored with a healthy dose of sarcasm).&nbsp; It was easy for her mangers (remember the very young George Clooney as Booker?) to dismiss her and those like her, and what they found out is that the “everyone is replaceable” attitude isn’t a universal rule.&nbsp; The knowledge that walked out the door when she would quit had a value and the company didn’t figure out how to tap into it before it was lost.</p>
<p>Talk to your people.&nbsp; Shocking, right?&nbsp; But for the number of meetings we have, you would think we would have figured out how to be communicative.&nbsp; We have not.&nbsp; That tactic is not a good kind of repetition.</p>

<!--more--><p>Shawn Achor delivers an almost exhaustive look into the science behind happiness, and the impact it’s designed to have in our lives.&nbsp; I first met Shawn a couple of years ago at WorkHuman, the penultimate HR conference sponsored by Globoforce.&nbsp; He shared that scientifically, our brains naturally follow the path of least resistance.&nbsp; If we’re in a rut or a pattern of poor expectations or poor me, it’s more likely that we’ll approach each day returning naturally to that rut.&nbsp; We would have to train our brains to seek out happiness.&nbsp; It’s a proactive endeavor.</p> 
<p><em>(Shawn will be returning to WorkHuman, April 2-5, 2018, in Austin – visit <a href=""http://www.workhuman.com"">www.workhuman.com</a> and use discount code WH18INF-JBA)</em></p> 
<p>At times, happiness seems a silly pursuit.&nbsp; Feeling elated is a temporary pleasure.&nbsp; Too many others have wasted time and resources in the endeavor of pleasure.&nbsp; You’ve seen that game and it doesn’t last.&nbsp; We’ve all seen the damage it can cause to the seeker as well as to those around him/her.&nbsp; It seems immature to run after that.</p> 
<p>Ideally, happiness is a mindset based upon a state of being (joy).&nbsp; As a result of joy, our hearts are happier and vibrant.&nbsp; What we put our efforts towards (home, work, relationships) will blossom and flourish.&nbsp; The science behind this is there. &nbsp;For example, in 2014, a study was completed by the University of Warwick in the UK showing that happiness made people around 12% more productive.&nbsp; What employer would say no to that?</p> 
<p>And let’s be clear regarding short-term and long-term happiness.&nbsp; Pleasure regarding a particular event or experience is not going to give lasting productivity improvement.&nbsp; It will add to the overall contentment quotient, but in and of itself, it is not enough.&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet, organizations spend most of their energies on short-term happiness agendas.&nbsp; Doing so leaves an unorganized and misdirected trail of one-time moments with static productivity.</p> 
<p>Chris Gardner (Will Smith) says, “It was right then that I started thinking about Thomas Jefferson on the Declaration of Independence and the part about our right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. And I remember thinking how did he know to put the pursuit part in there? That maybe happiness is something that we can only pursue and maybe we can actually never have it. No matter what. How did he know that?” He knew that because of the same reasons we know it. Happiness doesn’t naturally land on our laps, we have to look for it, change our perspectives and change our circumstances, if need be.</p> 
<p>And the science of psychology is real here as well.&nbsp; In a recent <strong>Psychology Today</strong> article, <a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-traits-excellence/201702/the-pursuit-happiness"">Robert Maurer</a> states, “Perhaps, though, happiness is not meant to be pursued, but instead to be practiced.”&nbsp; He elaborates by pointing to the oft-realized lack of satisfaction for many when goals are realized.&nbsp; There is temporary bliss, but our internal monologue of “now what?” or “who cares?” or “you’re still not good enough” starts quickly afterwards.</p> 
<p>That’s why we need to be diligent in training our minds and laying a foundation of contentment that’s built to last.&nbsp; As leaders and influencers in our homes, workplaces and communities, encourage long-term pursuits.&nbsp; Productivity and health will improve, as well as your overall disposition and demeanor.&nbsp; Not a bad return, right? I see you smiling.</p>

<!--more--><p>Imagine being the focus of such attention and not being able to live up to that expectation.&nbsp; It must be quite overwhelming.&nbsp; You likely would not want to talk to anyone, avoid the news and begin searching for your new home address. &nbsp;The pressure is great.&nbsp; And while most of us won’t know what it means to fail this publicly, how well do you know your failure?</p> 
<p>The pressure for perfection might be your root cause for failure.&nbsp; Perhaps living in such a way that you don’t figure grace into the conversation to yourself leads to failing moments.&nbsp; Listen to the internal dialogue.&nbsp; Do you give yourself a break ever?&nbsp; That treadmill of perfection might feel valuable at moments, but in the long run the drain on your system is wasteful.&nbsp; Understand that perfection is not the same as excellence.&nbsp; Be excellent in the work you do so as to move the team and/or project to where it should go.&nbsp; Perfection will often distract others from running that race with you, and that will in turn demotivate you.</p> 
<p>Perhaps your struggle is more about perception.&nbsp; What will people think of me if I fail?&nbsp; The cliché that failure is a learning opportunity is true, but for many, it doesn’t feel like a real answer.&nbsp; It is theoretical, not practical.&nbsp; The abstractness will affect your self-esteem. &nbsp;You’ll fill in the blanks with self-doubt, inability and insecurity.&nbsp; People are, by and large, not out to get you.&nbsp; Known failure is usually met with understanding by the rest of the team.&nbsp; And for those failures where people don’t understand, sympathy is a likely result.&nbsp; Either way, the perception issue is self-imposed mostly.&nbsp; You think you’re the only person to fail?&nbsp; Right.</p> 
<p>Or finally, the possibility of failure is crippling enough.&nbsp; You won’t risk due to what might happen.&nbsp; And the failure that happens here is that you don’t.&nbsp; You don’t try.&nbsp; You don’t engage.&nbsp; You don’t offer a point of view.&nbsp; And all of those things are failure anyway.&nbsp; You’re not really avoiding anything, just re-labeling it.&nbsp; Possibility is just that, possible.&nbsp; It is not a guarantee of success.&nbsp; It is not a commitment to anything working for sure.&nbsp; It’s an intelligent risk that is based upon reasonable criteria that has a chance of working.&nbsp; That is far from definitive.&nbsp; Lighten up on the failure fear.</p> 
<p>One of the best ways to combat failure’s impact and reach is to talk about it.&nbsp; I know it’s not earth-shattering, but it’s also not done often enough.&nbsp; Laurie Ruettimann, when <a href=""http://laurieruettimann.com/2017-failure/"">blogging about her most recent larger failure</a> wrote, “Did I learn a lot while failing? Sure. People have specific problems and challenges in the workplace, but they’re not always honest about it.”</p> 
<p>Think about the ways you handle your failure and the way in which you handle failure for others.&nbsp; A measure of grace should abound in both.</p> 
<p>It’s easy to criticize the Men’s Olympic hockey or figure skating teams, but I also know that if I were in their shoes (or skates), I would be heaping on plenty of criticism to myself. &nbsp;I don’t need the help.&nbsp; What I need is understanding, and when I am ready for it, advice.&nbsp; Armchair coaches are the worst.&nbsp; Often, it happens because we’ve been the victim of rough criticism, and this is now our chance to payback.&nbsp; Don’t give into it.&nbsp; In the times where I have bombed big time, I really just wanted someone to let me vent about it, not to have someone try to tell me what I already knew.</p> 
<p>So, as you train for the 2022 Winter Olympics, add some training on dealing with failure.&nbsp; It just might come in handy.&nbsp; And don’t forget to stretch first.</p>

<!--more--><p>And by whose standards are we defining these terms?&nbsp; When is rain too much rain?&nbsp; Or heat too much heat?&nbsp; And what about “gloom of night”?&nbsp; What the heck does that mean?&nbsp; If I am up in the middle of the night, I am beyond gloom.&nbsp; I’m officially irritated.</p> 
<p>We want to mean what we say, don’t we?&nbsp; If I am not going to be all that I have said I am, then I should change it, not overly qualify it.&nbsp; If I say to my kids, “I am going to be the best dad ever,” can I really meet that charge?&nbsp; Doubt it (although I am pretty darn close).&nbsp; What I say is that “I will do the very best I can to be a great dad.”&nbsp; I know that some days my best is not good enough.&nbsp; I try, but I might come up short.</p> 
<p>Too emotional for you?&nbsp; Am I making you question who you are?&nbsp; Good.&nbsp; But, let’s be simpler and make it about work.&nbsp; When you espouse your company as an employer of choice, what does that mean?&nbsp; If I don’t choose you, am I a fool?&nbsp; And if I want to choose you, do I start on Monday automatically?&nbsp; And while you may be preparing a long commentary for me, let me ask for your continued indulgence.</p> 
<p>In a talent-starved market, do we set ourselves up for failure by wooing people in by touting a string of superlatives?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Do we cause staff to compare what they are experiencing to these superlatives regularly?&nbsp; Yes.</p> 
<p>Think about how many similes, metaphors and hyperbole you have at work (seriously, you can’t remember 7<sup>th</sup> grade English class?).&nbsp; Check out your company values.&nbsp; Are we a family? Treat each other like family?&nbsp; Besides the scarring that might conjure up for talent, it is not true.&nbsp; While we would like to fire some family members, we really cannot do that; but we can at work.&nbsp; I don’t remember the last performance review I had with my dad, but I can with staff members.&nbsp; Listen to what you are saying – in spoken and written word.&nbsp; What is it you really mean?&nbsp; Say that.</p> 
<p>And those “always” and “never” statements…please.&nbsp; You always put the customer first?&nbsp; You’re all about fostering a comfortable work environment? (insert attitude-ridden eye roll)</p> 
<p>Nit-picky?&nbsp; I don’t think so.&nbsp; We are a society that is quick to judge words.&nbsp; Why wouldn’t we be more mindful about words at work?&nbsp; It’s the brand and the reputation that’s at stake.&nbsp; Protect it by being clearer about what you mean to say.</p> 
<p>This can really be an incredibly helpful exercise to do with your leadership team.&nbsp; Ask each person write down what it means to work at the organization.&nbsp; Often, we look to define our companies by what we wish were true rather than what is so.&nbsp; Own where you are today.&nbsp; Embrace it; that’s authentic.&nbsp; Those shared sentiments from such a meeting can formulate the work experience and identify traits to highlight.&nbsp; Broadcast those!&nbsp; Let that define the brand.&nbsp; And it allows senior leadership to measure what’s being done and what will be done up against it.</p> 
<p>And let me say that I really appreciate the time you’ve taken to read the best management and HR blog on the web.&nbsp; Err, at least the best blog on this particular subject.&nbsp; I mean, the best attempt at a blog.&nbsp; Well, oh forget it.&nbsp; Just thanks.</p>

<!--more--><p>Instead of computer assistance, I had to spend weeks turning in drafting penmanship sheets.&nbsp; Literally, I had to write my alphabet and numbers over and over again until I became a consistent font.&nbsp; Fun?&nbsp; Not at all.&nbsp; It actually led to my decision to move away from architecture.</p> 
<p>But truth be told, there is something about learning the basics that is vital to a long-term view of work to be accomplished.&nbsp; I was microscopic in my view of drafting – those darn letters!&nbsp; I didn’t have enough desire for the end game to appreciate the discipline.&nbsp; And no matter how much I tried to look beyond the font writing, I could not.</p> 
<p>Are you banging your head against the wall trying to figure out why you’re doing what you’re doing?&nbsp; Has the task become blinding to everything else, including the end game?</p> 
<p>In management, we deal with people all day long.&nbsp; We are to direct them – their work, their progress, their end game.&nbsp; And when we manage, we review work and process.&nbsp; That’s not leading them necessarily, but it’s a valuable construct to uphold.&nbsp; Someone must manage the work.</p> 
<p>But you cannot create desire as a manager.&nbsp; You can paint the picture of what could/should be.&nbsp; You can explain why Step A leads to Step B.&nbsp; You can drive home the inputs and outcomes.&nbsp; But, you cannot make someone passionately committed to it.</p> 
<p>Look at your team.&nbsp; What is happening there?&nbsp; Are hours being spent trying to convince someone to commit to what they’re doing?&nbsp; And now explain how this isn’t like trying to get someone to like-like you (you know what “like-like” means…don’t act like you don’t).&nbsp; It’s a futile effort.&nbsp; And you learn this about people by spending time with them.&nbsp; You can’t guess that someone is not committed in five minutes; I know there are people who can read others very well, but you may not be one of them.&nbsp; Test the waters, give assignments to expose their desires for work and converse with them after the fact.</p> 
<p>What if you’re not sure where someone is?&nbsp; Have an honest dialogue.&nbsp; Ask where his/her heart is.&nbsp; If it’s not on the work, then where is it?&nbsp; If he/she is only there to punch a clock, and the bare minimum of work is being met, then don’t expect more than that.&nbsp; Stop spending hours convincing these folks otherwise.&nbsp; Sail with the fast ships instead.</p> 
<p>It’s not mean.&nbsp; For those of us in HR, this is tough.&nbsp; We don’t want to see anyone on the outskirts.&nbsp; We are trainers of inclusion and collaboration.&nbsp; We are committed to the whole.&nbsp; And we should be.&nbsp; But think of it like this, investing in those without a desire to be fully present and committed to where things are going is diverting those resources away from those who want/need them.</p> 
<p>Knowing that drafting wasn’t my desire was freeing!&nbsp; I needed to know and I learned it by trying.&nbsp; No one made me feel badly for recognizing that I didn’t desire that.&nbsp; The same can hold true for those around us.</p>

<!--more--><p>We would like to believe that the this isn’t real life, but it is.&nbsp; We would like to believe that each of us is immune to caring about things like appearance, but we do.&nbsp; We would like to believe that each of us can see a person for who he or she is without the distraction of anything shallow, but we are distracted.&nbsp; And while plastic surgery may not be the answer (I’d be first in line), the reality is that we do have to know the lay of the land.</p> 
<p>And for that dancer, the gift was insight into its construct.&nbsp; She viewed her feedback.&nbsp; She got the chance to peek at the review cards and notes made by the director.&nbsp; He didn’t offer them to her, but she knew that success was eluding her.&nbsp; And she had to know.</p> 
<p>Many of you have likely been schooled by your HR department to not write notes during an interview which might seem discriminatory, and rightly so.&nbsp; And while being off-the-record to let someone know that his/her looks are a 3 is ill-advised, some viable and applicable feedback to candidates and to employees looking to advance is important.</p> 
<p>Unless there is a BFOQ (man, I love working that in every so often), it’s not likely your real feedback is that you’re not pretty or handsome enough.&nbsp; However, those real reasons why someone isn’t qualified or eligible for the role should not be a secret.&nbsp; Feedback other than “you’re just not a fit” will help to respect the hiring process and the candidate experience.</p> 
<p>Too often, we avoid talking to the candidate altogether.&nbsp; We just send some obnoxious, impersonal email after the person’s been through 4 interviews.&nbsp; Really?&nbsp; We took hours of his/her time and we can’t finish with a conversation?</p> 
<p>Many times, I have had the opportunity to share with someone the reasons he/she was not selected for the position or for the promotion.&nbsp; There is actually a way to share that can illuminate and motivate rather than insult and deject.&nbsp; Paint the full picture. If it was close between two candidates, then let the non-chosen one know that.&nbsp; If it was not close at all, let the person know that.</p> 
<p>When I tried out for baseball as a kid, I made the team.&nbsp; However, I was not the best player or even an average player.&nbsp; I made the team because they needed a certain number on each team and I was personable.&nbsp; If we have to have 12 on the team, then at least pick someone who is funny, nice, kind, etc.&nbsp; So, while I would have loved to be the next Mike Schmidt (actually, I wanted to be Larry Bowa at shortstop), I accepted the positives that I brought to the team and learned to improve some of the skill areas I needed to.&nbsp; My coach was (brutally) honest with me.</p> 
<p>Find the right level of feedback.&nbsp; Share assessment results, highlight function areas of improvement, give examples of communication struggles, provide guidance for the next interview whether with you or not.&nbsp; Honest, productive feedback will reflect on the culture of the company, too.&nbsp; There are candidates who will leave an interview process where they did not get the job, but they are committed to landing the next open role you have.&nbsp; The experience won them over to the organization.&nbsp; That’s a great candidate!</p> 
<p>Talent doesn’t just grow on trees in the shape and variety we desire.&nbsp; We should be more aware of the cultivating process and responsibility we all have.&nbsp; How do we do that?&nbsp; Get together with legal, HR and management to devise a plan for feedback.</p> 
<p>It’s worth noting that sometimes our feedback will seem hurtful.&nbsp; Think long term.&nbsp; If I wanted the lead in the next big Broadway musical, I will likely not get the job.&nbsp; My desire is there; my training is there; my commitment is there.&nbsp; What isn’t there, though, is a basic ability to sing on key.&nbsp; For my own career plans and time commitments, I would need someone to tell me this.&nbsp; Yes, it will hurt in the moment, but it would save me years of frustration.</p> 
<p>Oh, and yeah, there’s no surgery to get me to sing on key…I’ve looked into it.</p>

With all that has been going on with the #metoo ","2018-01-04 05:00:00","2022-05-26T21:08:36.709Z","<p>If you see something, say something.&nbsp; These words have been on repeat in my head over the last few months.</p> 
<!--more--><p>With all that has been going on with the #metoo movement, I’ve been feeling challenged to consider my responsiveness.&nbsp; As an HR pro, our approach to any claim of sexual harassment should be swift and thorough.&nbsp; Investigation is not a nice idea, but a necessity for a balanced approach to both the accuser and accused. It’s life-altering for both sides, whether the accused is guilty or not.&nbsp; The professionalism and completeness of our investigation sets the right tone for justice and consequence.</p> 
<p>But that’s not where my problem has been.&nbsp; As a city kid, there is a code on the streets.&nbsp; The fink or rat label is death to a boy.&nbsp; You don’t tell what you know if it’s going to get a buddy into trouble.&nbsp; You protect your friends, and even some acquaintances.&nbsp; It was just understood amongst boys.&nbsp; Fighting against this code left you in a social abyss.&nbsp; And while it’s easy to say, in your mid-40’s or 50’s, that it should not matter, it does when you’re 7 or 8.</p> 
<p>In my early 20’s, I started to leave that code behind.&nbsp; I felt compelled to speak up for the underdog, the forgotten, the accosted.&nbsp; And while that’s all well and good, I still see myself influenced by one of the best pieces of advice I’ve ever gotten – “choose your battles.”</p> 
<p>And therein is the rub.&nbsp; How has my behavior allowed me to forego speaking out against what I’ve seen in order to be “wise” about the battles I enter?</p> 
<p>While I would like to believe that my selection of battles has been about wisdom and humility, I am not so sure that it hasn’t been about fear and avoidance at times.&nbsp; I am typically ready for a tete-a-tete these days, but that was not always the case.&nbsp; Did I miss a situation or circumstance that I should have paid attention to?</p> 
<p>Listen, this is not about me cleansing my soul because I am not really sure that will ever fully happen here on earth, but rather, this is a challenge for us to consider our blind eye.&nbsp; Is there so much foolishness in my heart that I have missed a cry for help?&nbsp; Have I swept situations away because I wanted to believe differently?&nbsp; Have you done something similar?</p> 
<p>Simply, it is time to challenge our unspoken credos.&nbsp; I must consider the influence of these codes in my life today.&nbsp; I can’t be held hostage to something, even subconsciously, that will harm others unfairly.&nbsp; I won’t stand for the jokes, the stereotyping, the “you know” mentality.&nbsp; For both men and women, black and white and everything in between, we have to choose better.</p> 
<p>Why didn’t I call this post “What the World Needs Now is Love” rather than “Foolish Heart”?&nbsp; Because this one is introspective for each of us.&nbsp; Yes, we need to love well those around us.&nbsp; We do that through a healthy approach to fairness, justice, compassion and strength.&nbsp; But those realities last when based upon an honest and secure foundation.&nbsp; That’s for each of us to get to.</p>

<!--more--><p>Decades ago (gulp), Ella did a series of commercials for Memorex.&nbsp; This company manufactured cassette tapes for the masses (look it up…they were something real).&nbsp; The premise of having Ella was her vocal range.&nbsp; She could shatter glass with her mezzo-soprano notes.&nbsp; Memorex would bet on its quality being so high that a recorded voice of Ella would still break glass; and so it did.&nbsp; The tagline was “Is it real or Memorex?”</p> 
<p>But, if you know anything about recording tapes, the quality does not remain intact forever.&nbsp; After a number of plays, the tape would start to degrade.&nbsp; Ella’s voice did not remain as it once had, at least on the tape.&nbsp; I had boxes of mix tapes that I made (think Guardians of the Galaxy) which now sound like warbled versions of bad karaoke.&nbsp; It’s not pretty.</p> 
<p>When you first hear the tape, it sounds as good as live.&nbsp; The more plays, the less live it sounds.&nbsp; The quality breaks apart.&nbsp; It’s very similar to our approaches to work.&nbsp; What we once did ten years ago may have been awesome.&nbsp; People were astounded.&nbsp; The content was dazzling.&nbsp; But, through the years, it’s lost its luster.</p> 
<p>Often, it comes back to us.&nbsp; We’ve dialed it in for a while.&nbsp; We took a training out of our closet and hoped to plug it in with the same effect.&nbsp; We’re not passionate or fresh about it.&nbsp; Think about your first trainer session, or your first handbook, or your first management presentation.&nbsp; Weren’t you nervous?&nbsp; Didn’t those nerves make you more attentive to what you were doing?&nbsp; Didn’t they push you to greatness?&nbsp; Thoroughness?&nbsp; Care?&nbsp; Just recycling the same stuff starts to sound very much like those warbled tapes.</p> 
<p>Be live, not Memorex.</p> 
<p>It could be difficult to sense that you’re less impactful.&nbsp; You might think you’re just as sharp.&nbsp; It’s best to ask for someone else’s opinion, or to survey the participants more regularly.&nbsp; You don’t want to live in your own world with this.&nbsp; Effective adoption of training and improvement is just as important as crafting the policy and content.</p> 
<p>Part of the secret sauce in being “live” is coming back to the why.&nbsp; Ask why this policy, training, conversation is important.&nbsp; Why does it matter?&nbsp; And what is the long-term impact, because of the content as well as effect to the culture?&nbsp; These answers should motivate.&nbsp; That motivation should be directed towards preparation and delivery.</p> 
<p>And it would be a mistake to not remind you of the old tried and true method of recording yourself delivering the material before doing so.&nbsp; This allows you to better hear the tone of delivery, the quality of your words and the intended meaning.&nbsp; We can be so convinced that our method is clear, and then we listen to a recording.&nbsp; We hear nuances that leave a door open to a different interpretation or adoption method.&nbsp; Those issues can be remedied ahead of the actual delivery.</p> 
<p>The cassette tape may have joined the 8-track (yes, fine, I’m old, whatever) in fading into a distant memory, but the lesson from Ella is clear.&nbsp; We can still “shatter glass” with our sharp content delivery, impassioned tone and colorful application.&nbsp; And nothing beats live.</p>

<!--more--><p>So why, when we get older, do we not encourage the same separation?</p> 
<p>Jo Frost, aka Super Nanny, encourages time out when providing corrective action to kids.&nbsp; She has a child sit in chair, on a step or on a mat for one minute per year of age.&nbsp; 6 year-olds get to sit for 6 minutes.&nbsp; Very straight forward.&nbsp; And if the child gets up sooner than he/she should, then you just pick the child up, place him/her back in the time out area and start the time over again.&nbsp; Behavioral modification in a basic form.</p> 
<p>Interestingly, we assume that our staff have experienced a basic indoctrination towards behavioral modification.&nbsp; Think about how often you use the word “should.”</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>“I can’t believe he did that. He should know better.”</li> 
 <li>“I mean, really? She is an adult and should behave like one.”</li> 
 <li>“Do I have to train on communication skills again? These people are supposed to be professionals. This should not be necessary.”</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Sometimes those “should’s” should alert us to our own false assumptions about our people.&nbsp; If someone grew up without an emphasis on personal space, boundaries, dealing with conflict or manners, then why would we expect miraculous responses from such a person?&nbsp; A first step for us might just be the basic behavioral modification example.</p> 
<p>Take people out of a tense situation or conversation when you see it moving towards unhealth.&nbsp; Perhaps don’t use the phraseology of “sit in this chair for the next 44 minutes” (likely an ADEA violation...) but instead, introduce it as a reason to gather thoughts and focus on the point of the disagreement or tension.&nbsp; As we all know, in those moments, we can digress into majoring in the minors and miss the overall point we were trying to make.</p> 
<p>This is a first step.&nbsp; Stress management and conflict resolution are skills that we can affirm often and in various ways, but we must know that everyone is beyond the starting point.&nbsp; Help these folks get caught up.&nbsp; It’s most likely to occur in those conflict-related moments.&nbsp; An associate can appreciate that things got tense once he/she steps away.&nbsp; That’s why the step-away opens a new door.&nbsp; Staff can learn to cope, to process and to respond more maturely and in a helpful, productive manner.</p> 
<p>I have observed staff conflict that started with one person’s recommendation for a change in process from another and turned into various commentary about each other’s mothers.&nbsp; And while I can appreciate the creativity in the comebacks (really, there have been some amazing responses through the years…I should write a book), it’s likely not the tactic most beneficial for any facet of the business.&nbsp; And yet, those times have opened the door the widest for behavioral consideration around training and development.</p> 
<p>Of course, we won’t need to look for those opportunities.&nbsp; They usually show up in our doorway.&nbsp; So, practice your best British accent and address that unacceptable behavior.</p>

<!--more--><p>Alas, most of us don’t have this gift (I could say all, but hey, I’m in HR. I have to be inclusive just in case!).&nbsp; We are stuck with the gifts we have to deal with life’s situations.&nbsp; And those gifts aren’t bad, but our attitude about them might be.</p> 
<p>Deferring action because we think we aren’t the most qualified or able-bodied person isn’t always the right course of action.&nbsp; Sure, if you have access to buying expert talent or knowledgeable involvement, do it.&nbsp; Those resources are awesome and should work together to help you improve your organization.&nbsp; Sometimes, though, those resources aren’t as readily available.&nbsp; Or worse, those resources become a crutch to your professional development.</p> 
<p>Your development matters.&nbsp; What are you doing to grow?</p> 
<ul> 
 <li><strong>Challenge Yourself</strong> – Decide to engage in your own areas of weakness. If you don’t understand compensation analytics, then get together with someone who does.&nbsp; If that’s not available, read up on it.&nbsp; Watch some videos.&nbsp; Listen to a podcast.&nbsp; There are more resources at your disposal than ever before.</li> 
 <li><strong>Attend Events</strong> – There are still great opportunities to learn in a group setting. National conferences are awesome, but not every employer will help you get there.&nbsp; Instead, look for local SHRM, ATD or Chamber of Commerce events.&nbsp; Register and attend, even if you’re not sure about the topic and speaker.&nbsp; There are plenty of bad speakers, yes, but there are plenty of good conversations that happen with colleagues afterwards.&nbsp; Even if your disapproval of the presentation, you’re challenged to think critically and develop your philosophies of engagement/work/HR.&nbsp; Oh, by the way, there are lots of good speakers, too.</li> 
 <li><strong>Volunteer to Present</strong> – Think it’s easy? No?&nbsp; &nbsp; That’s just a reason you should start to present.&nbsp; And these opportunities don’t need to be grand.&nbsp; Perhaps host a small group at your office.&nbsp; Have 3-5 people come over so that you can share what you’ve been learning on a particular topic.&nbsp; This will help you to articulate your position.&nbsp; This is of benefit to both the hearer and to you.&nbsp; It will develop you as a presenter, yes, but more to the point, it develops your subject matter aptitude.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>There are other ways to develop, but this sampling can get you started on the right foot.</p> 
<p>Sometimes, we wish that things were different.&nbsp; We wish that we knew more, had more time, etc.&nbsp; The simple truth is that you do this each day.&nbsp; There is no magic.&nbsp; No wands, no spells, no tricks.&nbsp; Make the choice to invest in your own professional development.</p> 
<p>And if you recall, Bewitched was 30 minutes of misunderstandings, missteps and mistakes.&nbsp; Even witches don’t have it all together.</p>

<!--more--><p>Is that what our businesses have become?&nbsp; The desperate kid trying to fit in?&nbsp; You do know that those kids are obvious to others around them.&nbsp; It’s not a secret that they will do anything to be liked.&nbsp; So, if you think your employees are unaware of a company trying to do the same, you’d be mistaken.</p> 
<p>When Jennifer Lopez’s character, Mary, in <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209475/""><u>The Wedding Planner</u></a> realizes that she’s missed out on so much of life because she’s been devoted to the brides she works for, it’s a heavy sadness.&nbsp; She sees that her desire to work hard was really about pleasing everyone.&nbsp; She even gets to the point of agreeing to marry someone she doesn’t love, just so she can be married and satisfy her father’s wishes.</p> 
<p>And now, I see the hands raised wanting to challenge, or perhaps rebuke, me.&nbsp; Easy now.&nbsp; Of course, our organizations have to be appealing.&nbsp; But at what cost?&nbsp; Are we driving towards the latest trend in order to be “tight” and so that our staff knows they work for a “lit” company?&nbsp; (Apologies if I am blowing your mind with my use of current lingo…substitute those words in quotes with hip, cool or phat, if you prefer).&nbsp; The talent we have and the talent we want should represent more for the company than just the A-level high school socially-desirable crowd.</p> 
<p>Over the past two weeks, I have attended two conferences.&nbsp; I couldn’t help but notice the giveaway stuff at the booths.&nbsp; There were so many fidget spinners available.&nbsp; And while I can appreciate the original intended ADHD audience, it’s now become a fad.&nbsp; It’s not likely that all kids have ADHD, but rather, the spinners are cool.&nbsp; They spin for a while.&nbsp; It’s mesmerizing to stare at, just like a fire.&nbsp; Has your company given out fidget spinners to all staff to keep up with trend?</p> 
<p>It’s about balance and security.&nbsp; Trendy isn’t all bad, but has it become the goal?&nbsp; Have you put more time into the latest and greatest rather than sustainable core competencies?&nbsp; I know we need advancement of competencies.&nbsp; You share that at conferences, in group chats and in the Twitterverse.&nbsp; We are acutely aware of it.&nbsp; Let’s invest in that as much as being appealing, without being desperate.</p> 
<p>If we have too much of our individual or corporate esteem tied into the audience we’re serving, we have it backwards.&nbsp; Let those around you and those you want to attract into the company see that you’re a functional, smart, balanced, creative organization.&nbsp; They will make healthier assumptions and connections to the company’s message.&nbsp; And from there, about others who work there.&nbsp; A candidate will be more inclined to want to join in.&nbsp; Just throwing out fidget spinners, 4 weeks of vacation, Friday half days, Taco Tuesdays, and HumpDay Happy Hours are not sustainable.&nbsp; They become old quickly, and therefore, make it easier to move on.</p> 
<p>Check your organization’s motives and strategies.&nbsp; Align them to a balanced approach to corporate culture, investment and influence.&nbsp; Be willing to be that bold, just not desperate. &nbsp;Don’t be a Mary!</p>

<!--more--><p>The conference started out with a conversation regarding women in HR technology.&nbsp; There were statistics about underrepresentation, pay disparity and disproportionate advancement opportunities.&nbsp; And for many in the room, there was nothing new about those realities.&nbsp; 82% of tech promotions are male.&nbsp; The ability for women to prove their worth is still wrapped in a context of over-emotional fear.&nbsp; Stereotypes abound.</p> 
<p>And yet, that was not what the conversation was about.&nbsp; Yes, it provided a context, but the message was about delivery.&nbsp; As in any business initiative, answering the bottom-line, results-needed perspective is crucial.&nbsp; What difference will D&amp;I initiatives make in our industry?&nbsp; In our company?&nbsp; And the women who shared their thoughts pointed to that objective brilliantly.</p> 
<p>It’s a great reminder for us that in all our HR work, we have to do the same.&nbsp; It’s a universal application.&nbsp; So, look at your requests to senior management.&nbsp; Have you provided the kind of context that is needed to show business advancement?&nbsp; There will be math involved (scary, I know), but somehow, you’ll have to measure this.&nbsp; A feeling is great, but what lasting impressions could that feeling bring?&nbsp; An experience is great, but is it a one-time mountaintop rush rather than a piece towards a business objective?</p> 
<p>Often, I hear VERY well-meaning HR folks talk about needing software to make their jobs better, easier, faster.&nbsp; I very rarely hear a business plan behind why it is so.&nbsp; And further, very few lead with the business plan rather than the mere request.&nbsp; Our leadership should understand that without such a system, product or integration, here’s how much money we’re losing and time we’re wasting (with real data!).&nbsp; It’s much harder to ignore those realities.</p> 
<p>If you don’t know where to start, just look at your organizational mission and values.&nbsp; Perhaps with where the last failure occurred.&nbsp; Or if you’ve recently made a pitch to your manager, go back to look at from a delivery perspective and retool.</p> 
<p>And one other point made during the women in HR tech sessions, if you need to be coached, ask for it.&nbsp; A consistent thread of success for these women was their willingness to find people who knew more than they did.&nbsp; They learned from them.&nbsp; They asked good questions.&nbsp; They tested out that advice.&nbsp; They adopted what worked.</p>

<!--more--><p>The “good” news is that we’ve come up with a great solution – the employee handbook.&nbsp; As long as it’s in the handbook, our employees have a road map.&nbsp; Now they know all that they should to be successful at the organization.&nbsp; What an amazing gift we’ve given them (insert sarcasm).</p> 
<p>Many employees are handed this manual on the first day of work.&nbsp; Whether it’s complied electronically or on paper (electronically is so much easier!), it winds up being a massive mix of compliance, rules, operations and marketing.&nbsp; And if you’re googling “employee handbook” and using a sample or another company’s manual, you’re most likely getting it wrong for your team.</p> 
<p>The foundation for the handbook should be considered first.&nbsp; Ideally, it’s meant to be a review of employee policies, so let it be that.&nbsp; Cover the federal, state and local rules in it; make sure the ones you’re using apply to your company based on size, industry and locations.&nbsp; Walk through the time off/vacation policies and accruals.&nbsp; If there are standard policies – dress, travel, etc. – then add those.&nbsp; And yes, I know that this can be lengthy (so sorry California, Massachusetts and New Jersey) but it will give the company the protection it needs while addressing areas that will matter to employees, if not today, then at some point.</p> 
<p>Creativity can come into play regarding setup and some language, but bear in mind that some laws should be explained in a very cut and dry way.&nbsp; It is what it is.&nbsp; Being too cutesy with it may undermine the intent of the regulation and cause your lawyers’ heads to spin.&nbsp; FMLA, anti-harassment and anti-discrimination, for example, should be clearly delivered within the bounds of the law’s language.</p> 
<p>Some organizations treat their handbook like it’s a love letter to the employee.&nbsp; As long as love is understood to include both compassion and discipline, then love it may be.&nbsp; Yet, refusing to address consequences of violating these regulations doesn’t make your company seem cooler.&nbsp; It makes it seem more open to sue.</p> 
<p>If you want there to be other areas to address – operations, culture – then, perhaps, it would be better to create some other material.&nbsp; Trying to put all of this into one handbook makes an 80 page, two-sided manual that will likely not be read.</p> 
<p>One other thought is to involve your marketing department on this.&nbsp; The creativity and design for the brand falls on their shoulders.&nbsp; The handbook should align with it – in look and in messaging.&nbsp; It doesn’t mean that we re-write the law in order for the manual to stay on brand.&nbsp; Rather, it will help to make the handbook something that seems to flow better with other communications from the company.</p> 
<p>We’re entering that season soon where handbooks will need to be updated.&nbsp; Think about the overall feel and format of it.&nbsp; And then read it.&nbsp; Does it say all you think it should?&nbsp; Does it say too much in this one manual?&nbsp; How can it be edited?&nbsp; Should it be edited?&nbsp; Lots to think through.</p> 
<p>As you construct it, you might find yourself getting blurry-eyed with the regulatory language.&nbsp; Grab a copy of any <u>Diary of a Wimpy Kid</u>, regress for about 15 minutes and then get back to it. &nbsp;You will have to fight the urge, however, to add stick figure cartoons throughout the handbook.</p>

<!--more--><p>The more I think about being resilient, the more careful I feel I need to be.&nbsp; If some-<em>thing</em> is resilient, it’s a more consistent quality than if a person is.&nbsp; A pot that takes a beating in the kitchen but still maintains its shape is resilient.&nbsp; A person who takes a “beating” in the office might be considered resilient or a glutton or a dope.&nbsp; Where’s the line?</p> 
<p>Not everyone has the capacity for resilience.&nbsp; We would like to believe so, but it’s not true.&nbsp; Some do not know how to muster a tough disposition.&nbsp; Understand, too, that tough doesn’t have to mean attitude.&nbsp; I know plenty of attitude-ridden people who do not maintain a fraction of toughness.&nbsp; Tough brings that ability to bounce back, deal with adversity in a proactive manner and heal decisively from a difficulty.&nbsp; Size, age, gender…none of that matters.&nbsp; There are some wonderfully tough people who are petite, elderly women.&nbsp; They are resilient.</p> 
<p>In human resources, we might not be seen as tough.&nbsp; For many, the moniker of “necessary evil” for human resources has lasted for an entire career.&nbsp; When you start from a position of weakness, it takes an incredible amount of strength to move passed it.&nbsp; The resolve that’s needed has to be based on a fierce belief that what you have to offer is unlike anything else the company could ever find.&nbsp; Do you believe it?</p> 
<p>Our resiliency is masked, too, at times due to our kinder nature.&nbsp; We’re right to be kind, but we must work to make sure our kindness isn’t mistaken for weakness…or stupidity.&nbsp; Having been able to be a fly on the wall, I have watched leadership look at one another and shake their heads when the senior HR person leaves the room.&nbsp; Usually I will call that out and ask where it’s coming from.&nbsp; The scariest part is that they’ll tell me.&nbsp; I’ve heard, “Don’t get me wrong, we love (insert HR pro name), but he/she just isn’t able to handle what we’re trying to do.”&nbsp; I have asked if the HR pro is weak, and the majority of times I am told “yes.”</p> 
<p>We are not weak, but there must be something in the way we demonstrate our expertise that translates as weakness.&nbsp; Being compassionate and resilient can work hand in hand.&nbsp; Where have you not shown the capacity for both?&nbsp; Start there.</p> 
<p>And for those who have fought back and swung the pendulum the other way, the defiance may not be helping you either.&nbsp; It’s not difficult to sense someone who is masking.&nbsp; Bravado is a good skill at times, but not a course of consistent action.&nbsp; It does show more weakness than you might imagine, even if you’re able to defeat monster machines from the future.</p> 
<p>Let’s be genuinely resilient – a toughness that lasts.&nbsp; One where we offer strength and compassion in the work we do; where we offer smarts and hearts.&nbsp; Basing our resilience on honest confidence, healthy compassion and critical thought will allow us to address issues from the surface to the core.&nbsp; And no execs will shake their heads when we leave the room; they’ll likely follow us out.</p>

And while I might not have my soul stirred by good video game development, there are plenty of others who will.</p> 
<!--more--><p>Consider what moves you.&nbsp; Likely there will be more than one way.&nbsp; And lest you think this is about being touchy-feely, know that there are chemical and physiological realities to your bodies when you are affected in this manner.&nbsp; Those realities will influence your thinking and your actions.&nbsp; Tapping into the source of such affection is profitable.</p> 
<p>Truth be told, I am a bit of a sap.&nbsp; I have yet to make it through a Folgers Holiday commercial without tearing up.&nbsp; The sentimentality of it all touches me. &nbsp;Even more so, the underdog and the marginalized seem to hit me hard.&nbsp; I root for the ones who are given little chance of success or of fitting in.&nbsp; I am broken for those who are devastated by their environment or victimized by falsehoods and hate.&nbsp; I am moved by those who overcome the world’s forced box of expectation and perceived fairness.</p> 
<p>In the early 1980’s, there was a movie called <u>Who Will Love My Children?</u> and it starred Ann-Margaret.&nbsp; Oh my.&nbsp; She played the mother of ten children, married to an alcoholic, who finds out she has terminal cancer and not much time left to live.&nbsp; Knowing her husband is ill-fit to care for the kids, she undertakes to find a home for each of her kids.&nbsp; I mean, just rip my heart out and stomp it on the ground.</p> 
<p>A tearjerker, yes, but it moved me to consider what others are going through.&nbsp; That experience, plus countless others, drove a deep desire for action around communication and compassion.&nbsp; My world was not as self-centered today as it had been yesterday, and my hope is that tomorrow will be even less so. &nbsp;I tapped into the gift of being affected.</p> 
<p>Understand, too, that being affected isn’t about crying either.&nbsp; While it may include that, it’s much more about a response.&nbsp; Anger at injustice, developing empathy, and moving against the grain of culture for what is right do not require tears.&nbsp; It requires action.&nbsp; When you are moved, you should move.</p> 
<p>For the organizations we serve, the conveyor belt of productivity removes the humanity from our eyes.&nbsp; Look around and consider those around you.&nbsp; How amazingly beautiful is it when those who struggle show up and give their roles all they’ve got?&nbsp; Celebrate that truth.&nbsp; Be moved by the strength found all around you.&nbsp; And teach others how to do the same.&nbsp; There are people who don’t know what to do with the movement inside.&nbsp; Some have been taught to ignore and push down such emotion; teach them how to harness it.&nbsp; It’s wasted energy to suppress it.&nbsp; Use it!</p> 
<p>Again, this is not purely an emotional exercise, but one of business cohesiveness.&nbsp; We are the same more than we think.&nbsp; When leadership – executives and management – tap into what moves them, they have eyes to see the micro-world around them as well as more clearly respond to a fluid workforce.</p> 
<p>Our people are the composers, artists and developers each day we’re with them.&nbsp; If no one is affecting anyone else in the organization, then things are out of sync.&nbsp; Correct it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Don’t wait for the team to come together around tragedy only.&nbsp; I know that when someone at work suddenly dies, there can be a brief period of togetherness.&nbsp; People are saddened and lean on one another; it feels good.&nbsp; But if it’s only event driven, then it will pass quickly.&nbsp; Allow that emotion to drive something more lasting.</p> 
<p>There are plenty of opportunities to be moved today.&nbsp; Once you know how you’re wired, help others do the same.&nbsp; Then tap into those truths and allow an influence on communication and upon process at your organization.&nbsp; This works at home as much as it does at your job, so enjoy the full 360 that this can be.</p> 
<p>And if you decide to watch Ann-Margaret in that movie, please don’t invite me over.&nbsp; I will be ugly crying all over the place…</p>

<!--more--><p>We can apply this thinking to various aspects and concepts in life.&nbsp; Democracy, for example, is an 8-bar piece of music that opens the door for a responsive dance that is much more like a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-6WR7-W2-g"">Paso Doble</a> rather than a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWOUITERLJM"">Waltz</a>, but nonetheless dynamic and beautiful.&nbsp; Our ability to compose and choreograph daily life ought to be grounded in phrasing.</p> 
<p>Think of the daunting task it would be to devise a routine for 12 dancers.&nbsp; Can you respond to the music, develop the movement, master the steps, teach the team and perform as a troupe?&nbsp; It’s overwhelming just to type it, let alone do it all!&nbsp; And while this is certainly the goal of a choreographer, it is not something that each of one them can see holistically.&nbsp; He/She starts with a small core phrase of movement.&nbsp; This movement serves as the anchor to what comes after as well as before.</p> 
<p>As we lead people in our various areas of responsibility, a phrase is likely the wisest way to begin.&nbsp; What’s the small gesture, movement or concept that is a right response to the music composition of our companies?&nbsp; Look at the mission, values, vision, but also, look at the flow of communication, the cause of our work and the dynamic diversity of our people.&nbsp; The various skill sets, heritages, work experiences, education, etc. of our people has a song to it.&nbsp; Listen.&nbsp; How does it make your heart and mind respond?</p> 
<p>That answer will lead you to the first phrase.&nbsp; Develop goals, methods, SOPs, communication flows, etc. from this phrase.&nbsp; Allow it to serve as core to your development rather than these independent ideas that we work hard to link together.&nbsp; Start from the inside out.</p> 
<p>When dancers fuse two forms of style together, it should be danced excellently to show seamless integration.&nbsp; If it’s clunky and disjointed, it’s blatantly obvious.&nbsp; Further, some dance forms are so far apart, that even the best dancer would have a tough time fusing.&nbsp; Similarly, look at the objectives and expectations for your team.&nbsp; Should they be fused together or are they so very different?&nbsp; If it’s too far apart, the employee’s movement is awkward.&nbsp; They are not sure what the next step should be, mostly because there isn’t an intuitive option.&nbsp; It all seems separate and unequal.</p> 
<p>So, how do you start?&nbsp; Take the time to listen to the heartbeat rhythm of your organization.&nbsp; Sit deep in its melody.&nbsp; What do you hear? Notice? Feel?&nbsp; Now, respond.&nbsp; Don’t worry about right and wrong now.&nbsp; Just respond.&nbsp; Jot down everything that comes to mind.&nbsp; Hates, loves, brokenness, beauty, shortcomings, victories…all of it.&nbsp; Then allow those brushstrokes to form a picture of sorts.&nbsp; Everything might not fit today, but start with a short phrase.&nbsp; What stands out to you?</p> 
<p>Hopefully, you have a trusted co-worker, but a good colleague in your field is good, too.&nbsp; Share with him/her what you have found.&nbsp; See if they can hear and appreciate the music.&nbsp; You are sharing a composition.&nbsp; Don’t worry about how it sounds.&nbsp; Not every symphony is evenly timed, so you’re in good company.&nbsp; Your initial audience of one will give you cues as to where the phrasing should be sharper and more detailed.</p> 
<p>And build upon it.&nbsp; Take those notes and move across the stage.&nbsp; How does the movement look now?&nbsp; Can I begin to teach those around me how to navigate the stage?&nbsp; The answer is yes.&nbsp; Come back to that core phrase if you begin to lose your way.&nbsp; It will keep you honest and focused.</p> 
<p>Finally, work within your style.&nbsp; I’m a bit more of a street dancer than a ballroom performer.&nbsp; It’s more authentic if the movements I offer sit in that gritty hip-hop flow.&nbsp; However, if I need to stand tall, shoulders back and head tilted, watch me do it.&nbsp; That only comes from knowing who you are first and then being able to adapt to the environment as needed.&nbsp; Start small and in your dance zone.&nbsp; Get comfortable in this, and the opportunity to change styles will become less daunting.</p> 
<p>You can do this.&nbsp; It’s not about being the best dancer, so to speak.&nbsp; It’s about responding the music of your organization, developing movement and bringing reactive change through your leadership.&nbsp; And you don’t need tap shoes to do it.</p>

I didn’t say because you’re a jerk), it is quite possible that clarity around work expectations is off.</p> 
<!--more--><p>In the movie, <u>New York, New York</u>, Robert DiNiro’s character, Jimmy, communicates in a very unique and unpredictable manner.&nbsp; In his expressed love for Liza Minelli’s character, Francine, he struggles to communicate his heart in a “pretty way” (as Francine desires) and let her know what he wants.&nbsp; He is reactive, impetuous and frustrated when others around him don’t get where he’s going – both personally and professionally.&nbsp; Francine is such a sweetheart throughout the movie that she sticks with him even though he doesn’t really help her to know where she stands in the relationship (His marriage proposal is awkwardly hilarious).</p> 
<p>Our staff might be in Francine’s shoes, and perhaps you’re a bit of a Jimmy.&nbsp; In your mind, there is a clear path.&nbsp; You can visualize where you are going and how you are going to get there.&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; But remember that you are the only one who can see inside your head.&nbsp; Those that you need or rely upon don’t get a special movie screening of your mental plan, unless you let them in.</p> 
<p>We have a fear of failure.&nbsp; We don’t want to offer our plans and then have everyone know when it doesn’t work out.&nbsp; The influence of our fear of failure causes us to hold too closely to the vest our plans.&nbsp; We want to get started with it, see how it goes without defining it as our plan, and then if it seems to be working, reveal our intentions.&nbsp; And while there may be a bit of wisdom in this, there is a tendency to wait too long to share those expectations and participation levels to staff.&nbsp; When you ride them to get done something that they don’t get a connection to, there is a likelihood for less excellent work from your team.&nbsp; They don’t get it.</p> 
<p>In a world clamoring for transparency (which isn’t always possible or helpful, btw), could this be an area to begin with?&nbsp; Set clear expectations and connect it to the work.&nbsp; Let your team know how and why.&nbsp; Afford them the opportunity to decide who on the team is best equipped to handle each portion of the plan.&nbsp; Let them own it more.</p> 
<p>By doing so, the tension around work output diminishes.&nbsp; It doesn’t mean that there won’t be stress around work creation or process, but it will be one that is embraced as the outcome desired is clear.&nbsp; There is healthy stress!</p> 
<p>Test out the theory.&nbsp; Sit with your frustrated team and ask what part of the process of work seems to be unclear.&nbsp; Let them be quiet for a minute.&nbsp; This is new for them, so they are not used to addressing such a specific question, perhaps.&nbsp; Then walk through the details around what’s brought up.&nbsp; Paint the right picture rather than just barking orders and timelines.&nbsp; Give them lighting for the path by connecting the reason for the work to the necessity of the goal.</p> 
<p>Of course, this won’t get your staff from asking each other, “What is he thinking?” But, it won’t be directed towards the work.&nbsp; Instead, it will mostly be about you as a person.&nbsp; And it’s not likely that a blog is going to fix all of what’s wrong with you, Jimmy.</p>

<!--more--><p>For some managers, they have dealt with a mom or dad who demanded much. &nbsp;School, sports, activities…all had to be completed with excellence.&nbsp; There was no room for second place.&nbsp; The pressure to excel was pushed by constant nagging and expressed disappointment.&nbsp; There was some praise, especially if a public accomplishment occurred, but mostly conversation about improvement when home.</p> 
<p>The response to this type of parenting often boils down to two options.&nbsp; Those who choose to rise to the occasion find themselves barraged with feedback for continual improvement.&nbsp; The work to be done is to make these areas better and therefore accomplish whatever the desired goal is (for the parent).</p> 
<p>The other option is to shut down.&nbsp; These children accept the fact that mom or dad will never be happy enough with their efforts.&nbsp; No amount of hours worked will provide satisfaction.&nbsp; The child resigns himself/herself to being a perceived disappointment, and the work done reflects a lack of motivation.</p> 
<p>As workers in our companies, we may find ourselves reacting to management in one of these two ways.&nbsp; If our managers ask us for improvement, we make the mental connection to the parental past from which we come.&nbsp; Our knee-jerk reaction is to slide into similar patterns.&nbsp; And the prospect of getting on the merry-go-round of seeking approval from our parent/manager seems even more exhausting (especially as we get older…so I’ve heard).</p> 
<p>Considering how little management training occurs in the workplace (not harassment or anti-discrimination training, but real hard and soft skill management training), it is natural to fall back into a pattern that is already known.&nbsp; Our parental relationship established a foundation for discipline, success, failure, appreciation and acceptance.&nbsp; It makes complete sense that this connection overlaps into our work environment.</p> 
<p>Are you the manager who expects much but is never satisfied with the work of your team?&nbsp; Or are you a manager who works to be as anti-establishment and unresponsive as possible?&nbsp; Stop and look at a few things:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li><strong>Expectation</strong> – is it realistic? Where is it coming from? Why don’t you have one?</li> 
 <li><strong>Team</strong> – are they qualified to achieve that goal? Have they been equipped? Do they understand the goal?</li> 
 <li><strong>Self</strong> – is your worth tied to the work? Is your perspective making up for some past mistake or failure? Are you diminishing your success?</li> 
</ul> 
<p>While this list may seem short, it is more than enough to get you started.&nbsp; This will lead you to a series of deeper questions that are much more specific and personal.</p> 
<p>Caring too little is not okay.&nbsp; You’re not helping your team by having them participate in your fight against the “man.”&nbsp; Mom and Dad don’t work on your team (if they do, I know a great counselor…) so stop fighting a fight you started when you were 13.&nbsp; You’re robbing yourself and your team of achieving something to be proud of; you’re not equipping them for future engagements.&nbsp; The management style by default is not working for your long-term effectiveness, and your superiors are likely to pick up on that soon.</p> 
<p>Come back to the center of work to be done, outcomes to reach and skills needed to do so.&nbsp; These few thoughts will help to get your management style functioning appropriately while getting you out of your unhealthy pattern of managing.&nbsp; The fact that you’ve become a manager should let you know that you’ve got something to build on; why let a default pattern of responsiveness to authority set you back?</p> 
<p>Listen, if Mom and Dad didn’t affirm your efforts, it’s okay.&nbsp; You have become something.&nbsp; You’re here; you’re making it.&nbsp; The over-achieving or under-achieving attitude is only hurting you now.&nbsp; You don’t work for your parents anymore; you work for yourself.&nbsp; Yes, there may be a boss in charge of you, but you answer to you first.</p>

True?  Have you ever met someone who did not want to work hard, but ","2017-06-15 04:00:00","2022-05-26T21:12:24.808Z","<p>Given an opportunity to work hard, we would take it.&nbsp; Let that settle in for a moment.</p> 
<!--more--><p>True?&nbsp; Have you ever met someone who did not want to work hard, but just good enough?&nbsp; Yeah, me too.&nbsp; From an HR perspective, it would be hard to write someone like that up.&nbsp; Is it a performance issue?&nbsp; Not likely.&nbsp; They are doing the core job responsibilities and providing a work product that allows for either service or production to move forward as it should.&nbsp; Again, the minimums (at least) are met.</p> 
<p>Perhaps we should change the minimums.&nbsp; That would show ‘em!&nbsp; Perhaps for some, but could be that the person will “rise” to the occasion of the new standard, but just.&nbsp; Flying under the radar by staying out of the fray of involvement with others more than necessary helps to keep this person on the fringe of team and of promotion.</p> 
<p>We think that dangling the carrot of advancement means something to everyone.&nbsp; It’s not always the case.&nbsp; There are folks who are happy to be a worker bee, do what is needed and then head back to the hive.&nbsp; We think that the person is barely breathing in the environment we’re building based upon some sort of experiential standard in our heads.&nbsp; And that rubs up against our motivational work-speak on long-term involvement and team building, especially in this climate of everyone wants advancement every 6 months.</p> 
<p>Are we okay with having worker bees?</p> 
<p>Part of the comfort with that answer lies in our ability to not take it personally.&nbsp; Someone who is content to punch a clock, do a respectable job and then go home should not make us feel like we’ve failed.&nbsp; This person’s desire is not meant to undercut your phenomenal managerial abilities or your talent development aptitude.&nbsp; Dare I say...It’s not about you.</p> 
<p>Further, there are ways to show appreciation for the person who is steady to meet work product.&nbsp; Think about the person who has a banner month.&nbsp; We celebrate, we make a fuss, we jump on the encouragement bandwagon.&nbsp; And then, in the next month, that person falls short of expectations.&nbsp; We meet with, inquire of and motivate that person.&nbsp; That all may be fine, but the annualized production of that person might actually mirror that of the slow and steady employee.&nbsp; The one who doesn’t get a fuss in any month, but who meets what’s required and demonstrates a consistent understanding of role and output sits equal to the up and down employee.</p> 
<p>Respectfully, this person deserves a bit of love and appreciation.&nbsp; Someone who knows what he/she wants and delivers a consistent performance should be appealing to us.&nbsp; We cannot expect everyone to want to be a supervisor or a corporate trainer.&nbsp; For sure, we can work with them regarding the technical components of the role – preparation, process and output – but we should not expect them to want to roll up their sleeves to lead the battle on any of those pieces.</p> 
<p>Take their knowledge and allow it work for the betterment of the team.&nbsp; If this person can figure out how to provide the minimum each day consistently, I submit there are some on the team for whom we would wish this truth.&nbsp; It’s not terrible to have someone own a worker bee role.</p> 
<p>Of course, this is not the same as the person who does the bare minimum with a lousy attitude, negative speak about the company and disobedient disposition towards management.&nbsp; That kind of pot-stirrer should be disciplined right out of the company.&nbsp; Do not pass Go and do not collect $200…Get the heck out of here.</p> 
<p>It’s not likely that our sourcing and recruitment strategy will include banners stating, “Work here and do the bare minimum!”&nbsp; However, these worker bees serve a real productive purpose.&nbsp; It’s not necessarily a reflection of what we’re doing wrong, but could actually be a part of what’s going right.</p>

<!--more--><p>The content is excellent.&nbsp; Adam Grant challenged my thinking regarding evaluating employees by asking me to consider the process towards success as much as the outcomes. &nbsp;Often, there is great value in the road built.&nbsp; The process can lead to innovation and participation as much as the results.</p> 
<p>Susan Cain gave a gentle reminder that the environment for your people, including the introverts, must be considered.&nbsp; “If we want people to do their best, we have to give them control over their own stimulation.” A light was turned on in a dark room for many with this statement.&nbsp; How often do we think one large open concept office will work for all?&nbsp; Or sequestered offices?&nbsp; We can assess our folks and help them be more alive in the environment that cultivates their drive.</p> 
<p>Of course, WorkHuman is known for its celebrity chats as well.&nbsp; Chaz Bono focused in on gratitude as a key step in his sobriety.&nbsp; He, also, reminded us that the necessity of time as a healer is real as he walked through the story of his gender transition.</p> 
<p>Julia Louis-Dreyfus was her hilarious self and gave us insight into the world of making a show.&nbsp; And what was very interesting was her declaration that she prefers to do ensemble work and not be the star.&nbsp; She finds that working along people who can encourage the best work in others in invigorating.&nbsp; And while she appreciates the “star” status she enjoys on Veep, it’s not accurate as the entire cast works as one cohesive unit.</p> 
<p>And closing out the main stage was Michele Obama.&nbsp; Listening to her heart for children was emotional for all, including the former First Lady.&nbsp; She challenged us to think about what we put together today and its impact on tomorrow.&nbsp; What kind of workforce are we building?&nbsp; What kinds of opportunities does that give others?&nbsp; How can we make sure that ALL of the children are doing alright?</p> 
<p>Peppered throughout the conference were other speakers who maintained the high bar set by the mainstage players.&nbsp; Again, a pursuit of excellence drove the conference.</p> 
<p>Even if you didn’t attend WorkHuman, let us consider how we are building better work teams and expressing gratitude.&nbsp; Making the workplace more human involves communication, recognition and collaboration.&nbsp; Are you working towards that today?&nbsp; What do you have in place at work to monitor such a push?&nbsp; Revisit this desire often!</p> 
<p>JLD (that’s Julia’s initials…just like she calls me JB, at least I want to believe that she does) gave another encouragement which was to have fun at all times.&nbsp; If you’re in a place where you can’t find or see the fun in the work, then something has to change.&nbsp; Shake things up a bit. Get back to dancing! Oh yeah, if you should see any pictures or video of me dancing at the conference, they are manipulated.&nbsp; I would never have such fun…</p>

<!--more--><p>So, what can it be?&nbsp; Opportunity.</p> 
<p>Ronald, played by Patrick Dempsey, finds a way to create opportunity to get into the crowd he thinks can set him up for long term success in “Can’t Buy Me Love.”&nbsp; When all of the toothpicks and rubber bands he has built for his new “It Guy” reputation come crashing down, he is back to the fringes but with no one standing next to him.&nbsp; He forced an opportunity based upon wrong expectations (hilarious to watch), but his high school life did ultimately change as a result.</p> 
<p>An open door can change the course of an evening event for an attendee.&nbsp; A kind introduction can alleviate the fear welling inside the new member.&nbsp; An inviting gesture to someone on the fringe will invoke a smile, which starts a chain reaction of confidence.&nbsp; These are not fanciful pictures alone, but viable considerations for inclusion, growth and development.</p> 
<p>Belonging is an ingrained desire for all of us; we’re wired for community.&nbsp; And while some only desire a community of a few, some are looking for hundreds.&nbsp; It does not matter.&nbsp; Our disposition towards connection runs deep.&nbsp; We want to know we’re okay, we belong and that we matter.&nbsp; A wallflower has these needs as much as the life of the party.</p> 
<p>In our developmental plans for teams, what does the concept of community look like?&nbsp; It would be unwise to assume everyone knows how to behave or respond to connection.&nbsp; Just as with many other skill development opportunities, the background and personal experience of each is varied.&nbsp; As such, the approach, expectation and result of the skill is not consistent with others.</p> 
<p>It is wise for us to instruct regarding community and connection.&nbsp; Most will appreciate that belonging is a basic need, but the expectations as to what that belonging means should be guided.&nbsp; I have watched very needy people feel consistently disappointed because the relationships they’ve made don’t fulfill them.&nbsp; In great part, this is due to their unrealistic expectations for community.&nbsp; It has not been a concept discussed with them during their formative years so they’ve adopted these unreachable ideals.&nbsp; It’s okay for us to provide guidance and clarity.</p> 
<p>The easiest starting point is to use team development opportunities.&nbsp; A community at our workplaces starts with the handful in a particular department or workgroup.&nbsp; How do they function?&nbsp; In what ways could they function better because of connection improvement and community impact?&nbsp; These answers will lead to the premise of a development plan.</p> 
<p>A wallflower isn’t necessarily an awkward person; just one looking for an open door.&nbsp; Grab the handle and open it with them.&nbsp; A buddy makes new adventures memorable and leave a lasting impression.</p>

"Humareso Blog","Pocketful of Sunshine","Pocketful of Sunshine – Humareso","en","https://blog.humareso.com/pocketful-of-sunshine","John Baldino","","I can recall having to work with someone, very early in my career, that I did not like.  She was rude and abrasive.  She literally would look down her nose","2017-05-12 04:00:00","2022-05-26T21:10:43.322Z","<p>I can recall having to work with someone, very early in my career, that I did not like.&nbsp; She was rude and abrasive.&nbsp; She literally would look down her nose at me when she spoke.&nbsp; I can recall the frustration I felt as if it were yesterday.&nbsp; And the worst part was that there was nothing to be done.&nbsp; We had to work together in our roles.&nbsp; We couldn’t reassign duties, change departments or work for a different team, unless one of us wanted to change career paths.&nbsp; And certainly, I was not going to change for her!</p> 
<!--more--><p>And yet, what I had to do was not only work with her, but collaborate. Seriously? I struggled so much to be my normal ray of sunshine (no comments, please).&nbsp; This was not ideal, but it was necessary.</p> 
<p>Collaborating with difficult people is, well, difficult.&nbsp; The personality and perspective differences can be palpable in a room where brainstorming and teamwork happen.&nbsp; Those observing the two relationally-challenged individuals sit in awkwardness and embarrassment.&nbsp; It’s a really good time for all.</p> 
<p>So, what’s the trick to collaborating with a difficult person?&nbsp; First, understand that you don’t know everything that is driving the individual to behave as he/she does. &nbsp;So often, there are stressors at play that have nothing to do with you.&nbsp; You may not know what’s going on at home, with other relationships, with health issues or financial strain.&nbsp; There are factors influencing this person and you may just be the ripe recipient of the difficult personality manifestation.</p> 
<p>Understand, too, that you are not so fabulous every minute of the day.&nbsp; I’ve seen you.&nbsp; I know you fall apart in the afternoon and need a nap.&nbsp; Your crankiness manifests itself in those moments.&nbsp; Or perhaps your Type A persona struggles with being right often.&nbsp; You cannot relent to someone else.&nbsp; Or maybe you have allowed stressors in your life to creep into how you behave as well.&nbsp; The mirror has two faces.&nbsp; Look deep and hard at yourself.&nbsp; Ask trusted people to keep you in line and point out your inconsistencies in a way that will get you to deal with them instead of transferring the emotion to a particularly difficult person.</p> 
<p>Focus on the work instead of the person.&nbsp; I know that is tough, but someone must do this.&nbsp; An approach that capitalizes upon the project to be completed rather than treating the difficult person as the project to be completed is most beneficial.&nbsp; And the focus on the work often leads to better understanding on both sides of the difficulty. &nbsp;Each other’s strengths unfold more clearly during while completing the work.&nbsp; Without the angst being the focus, the real reason that each of you were actually hired – competencies, aptitudes, critical thought – becomes apparent.</p> 
<p>In the Marvel Universe, this paradigm is explored in the relationship between Thor and Loki.&nbsp; They were raised as brothers (and family dynamics is another difficulty in and of itself) but had a falling out.&nbsp; Each found the other one beyond difficult to take (pepper in some superhero powers and now you have a blockbuster movie).&nbsp; To the chagrin of each, they needed the expertise and skills of the other at times.&nbsp; When they join forces against a common enemy, their tension for each other relents.&nbsp; Each supports the other in the job to get done.</p> 
<p>It’s not that you have to become best friends, or even just regular friends, with this difficult person, but it is in the best interest of the organization that you collaborate with all team members.&nbsp; In HR, we hear from our staff when they’ve had enough of a certain person.&nbsp; We listen to stories of stress and frustration.&nbsp; And so, this encouragement to approach interacting with a difficult person isn’t done blindly.</p> 
<p>The power that we give away to another in these situations is unnecessary.&nbsp; Why am I obsessing over this person?&nbsp; He/She is consuming energy and time of mine…and I am giving it away.&nbsp; Keep what is yours to control.</p> 
<p>And while this summer movie calendar may not feature your greatest battles with whomever that difficult person is for you, it just might be the summer that collaboration for the good of the work happens. &nbsp;And find an outlet to deal with any lingering frustration. &nbsp;Set up your punching bag with that difficult person’s face on it at home and unleash your super powers there.</p>

<!--more--><p>It’s a test for us.</p> 
<p>Am I cognizant of passions in others’ lives?&nbsp; Do I see value in their interests?&nbsp; This isn’t a warm and fuzzy perspective alone (but in part), but a potential for competency tracking.&nbsp; The fact that someone is a nut for pottery may not translate into a skill to use at work, but the traits of someone doing it might.&nbsp; Think of the patience in the methodology.&nbsp; Think of the fine motor skills for the detail work on each piece.&nbsp; Think of the focus required to see a finished product from a lump of clay while using your foot to spin the wheel.&nbsp; Lots to manage.</p> 
<p>There are ways to tie in those passions to the work at hand even if it’s not the specific task to complete while at work.&nbsp; The educational psychology of connecting new skills and patterns of work output to existing knowledge in similar habits or hobbies is brilliant.&nbsp; The work is to build bridges and to add to the files already being stored in the brain.&nbsp; This type of learning should be an HR practitioner’s dream to setup.&nbsp; It makes training and development opportunities more engaged and more successful.</p> 
<p>Start by listening to staff.&nbsp; As they share hobbies and interests, think about translating that into useful work-related opportunities.&nbsp; If you’ve not had a conversation where you let an employee know that his/her skills in a hobby translate, try it.&nbsp; Often, that employee laughs in mild disbelief at first, but once you help explain the translation, the enthusiasm bubbles up.</p> 
<p>Critical thought is an area of difficulty for many.&nbsp; We desire it in the workplace, but often have no time to cultivate it.&nbsp; By making connections to existing behaviors and concepts, it challenges mental processes of connection in other areas.&nbsp; A person will look more holistically at what he/she is about and how that works in more than one area of life.&nbsp; This leads to more critical thinking.</p> 
<p>Work with managers to listen better.&nbsp; Have them be students of their staff.&nbsp; A good coach works to get the most out of the team.&nbsp; Knowing what each has to offer is of utmost importance.&nbsp; Encourage managers to dig a bit and enjoy the cultural impact such discovery will have.</p> 
<p>Each talent possessed can and does overlap into usefulness in other areas.&nbsp; Upon victory early on, Hermione explained her skills by saying, “Books and Cleverness. There are more important things.&nbsp; Friendship and bravery.”&nbsp; She used her skills to open a door to deeper, lasting skills and attitudes.&nbsp; We can encourage the same.&nbsp; Help your staff to rise – Wingardium Leviosa!</p>

<!--more--><p>I remember watching Sybil for the first time while a senior in high school.&nbsp; The movie was exquisitely acted by Joanne Woodward and Sally Field (one of her best roles).&nbsp; The multiple personalities that Sybil was tormented by stemmed primarily from a parent who held firm to a belief in process.&nbsp; I know it was psychotic, but it was a procedure nonetheless.&nbsp; And while that was extreme and gut-wrenching to watch, is it any less impactful than watching a man being dragged off a United plane because of policy?</p> 
<p>At some point, we’ve raised the policy over the people.&nbsp; It is one of the worst forms of business un-development that we employ.&nbsp; Are our policies working for both our external and internal customers?&nbsp; Do they cause more customers to walk through the door or reach out to us online? Do they push internal talent to greater skill development or collaborative learning? It is quite possible that the policies meant to protect companies are the very ones that will squash culture and productivity.&nbsp; Restrictions for the sake of restrictions, without context, are constricting.</p> 
<p>Policy is meant to enhance the employee experience.&nbsp; In its primary role, it’s not punitive and it’s not authoritarian. &nbsp;Think of them as bumpers on a bowling alley.&nbsp; If you can learn to manage the proper throw while being protected from the gutters, it’s a more enjoyable learning experience.&nbsp; The throw is practiced and perfected, and soon those bumpers aren’t needed because the way to act and to respond has been learned.&nbsp; Even if the bumpers stay up, the bowler isn’t really looking at them and the toss of the ball won’t touch them either.</p> 
<p>When we live for the policy, actions like the United flight incident occur.&nbsp; We sit back and shake our heads as to how unbelievable and awful that incident was.&nbsp; But can we not see how we subject people to policy in other awful ways?&nbsp; The United flight incident is a valuable lesson for us to remember that we’re dealing with people, real people.</p> 
<p>Being certain of a process is important.&nbsp; Knowing why the policy has been put into place is vital.&nbsp; Applying that policy consistently is necessary.&nbsp; There is nothing here that I am offering to oppose those points.&nbsp; What is being shared is that these considerations should not be implemented to the destruction and devastation of our people.&nbsp; That devastation is often internal – creativity, innovation, commitment to the organization, collaboration.&nbsp; An employee is less likely to invest himself/herself to a company if he/she cannot make an impact.&nbsp; An impaired or unbalances commitment to policy will certainly make an employee sense that.</p> 
<p>Listen, I have watched the United video countless times (thanks to ABC, CNN and every other news outlet), and I am overwhelmed with sadness.&nbsp; I cannot believe that a paying customer would be treated in such a way.&nbsp; Yet, I couldn’t help sense that we figuratively may treat our customers and employees that way in our blind enforcement of policy.&nbsp; We may introduce a context to our staff that drags out their willingness to invest themselves into our companies; we’ve done that.</p> 
<p>Human Resources is not meant to be a cold, mechanical implementer of policy.&nbsp; It would be mindless for us to do so. We’re not mindless.&nbsp; Look at what and why we have the policies and processes we do.&nbsp; It’s time for a fresh consideration.</p>

<!--more--><p>Vacant stares, mindless reaction, thoughtless systematic approaches…sound familiar?&nbsp; Have our employees and teammates been replaced by pod-grown humanoids?</p> 
<p>We know there are staff who have checked out.&nbsp; They show up, but they’re not there.&nbsp; Good old fashioned presenteeism rears its head as a permanent condition in many companies.&nbsp; Our folks just punch a clock, do their work, punch out and head home, only to repeat again tomorrow.&nbsp; It doesn’t sound like much of a life.&nbsp; That’s because it isn’t.</p> 
<p>From a humanistic and perhaps moralistic perspective, we ought to encourage one another towards a more engaged approach.&nbsp; And we don’t do this to tout higher employee engagement survey numbers.&nbsp; Honestly, who cares about just the stats?&nbsp; Big deal that your staff feel more engaged.&nbsp; Are they really more engaged?&nbsp; Listen, the feeling counts; don’t get me wrong.&nbsp; But, I have felt things that didn’t necessarily drive me to do anything differently.&nbsp; Think about getting healthy vs. working out, or being moved by the work of a non-profit vs. volunteering, or appreciating kids vs. raising a family.&nbsp; There is a distinct difference between the feeling and the doing.</p> 
<p>When the doing doesn’t happen, the feeling doesn’t matter and will eventually become numb.&nbsp; What each person truly does matters.&nbsp; Is that a message that is held high to the people we work with and lead?</p> 
<p>And besides the millions of dollars wasted each year in the US alone due to the impact of presenteeism, there are other consequences.&nbsp; For instance, where will the next process improvement, product development or marketing rollout come from?&nbsp; Active engagement begets further activity.&nbsp; It’s not just that your staff complete a task, but how they do it as well.&nbsp; Encouragement around improvement should be an active stance of a manager who wants to drive a higher result of such improvement implementation.&nbsp; Therefore, everyone is active.</p> 
<p>Consider the mission of the organization.&nbsp; Is it passive or active?&nbsp; If it’s written actively, then that should permeate each nuance of the company, staff and work product included.&nbsp; The inconsistency in that messaging is what often allows the mission to only remain a nice plaque in the lobby.&nbsp; Of course, that is never the goal, but it is often the reality.&nbsp; Conduct an experiment with your team.&nbsp; Gather them, have them write the mission from memory (if they can!), and then jot down 3 ways that their jobs meet that mission.&nbsp; They might come up with one right away, but how about after that?&nbsp; That will assist you in aligning the vibrant activity of your team to the mission at hand.</p> 
<p>Management has a fantastic opportunity to draw excellence out of a team.&nbsp; Of the many challenges to do so, time might be the strongest.&nbsp; Yes, we’re all so busy.&nbsp; Yes, that’s true for almost all of us.&nbsp; And yet, it seems to take no time at all for a team to wither without the investment and push.&nbsp; Presenteeism isn’t an overnight phenomenon; it is the product of a sustained period where the expectation is very low or consistent and the motivation toward more is non-existent.&nbsp; So, it should be no surprise that it will take even more time to climb out of that perspective and inactivity.</p> 
<p>Grab hold of the reigns and re-align!&nbsp; You, too, may be suffering from “not being there” fully.&nbsp; Start with you and quickly let it spread to those around you.&nbsp; Be that influence, both because it is the right thing to do in the lives of others and because it positively impacts the business.</p> 
<p>Reclaim those snatched bodies and burn the pods of the inactive, disengaged replacements.</p>

Have you noticed the new phenomenon over the past few years regarding winter breaks for television shows? It’s no longer okay for shows to be off for a couple of weeks to deal with network holiday scheduling of seasonal favorites. We now must have two cliffhanger finales each broadcast year – one mid-winter and one late spring.</p> 
<!--more--><p>The writers now have the job of coming up with plot twist after plot twist to keep up with the double demand. And while the job of writing is a tough one, for sure, we wind up with rushed, weakened storylines that get pushed through due to time constraints. And it’s not easy to be brilliant in writing every day.</p> 
<p>In business, if you’re not growing, you’re dying. We’ve heard that once or twice before. Such pressure to be relevant and topical (like the life of a blogger perhaps?) in the midst of being reinventive and path-leading. Businesses have to keep up with the best, but more.</p> 
<p>Think about the great corporate messaging battles through the years – Coke vs. Pepsi, AT&amp;T vs. MCI, Miller Lite vs. Bud Light. Remember how much anticipation was wrapped around these commercials. We looked for new ones often, with new catch phrases, celebrities and jingles. The Super Bowl was the most anticipated time of the year for pinnacle awards in such excellence to be given. And yet, for the first time this year, substantial brands, like Doritos, declined to participate in the “$5 million for 30 seconds” commercial game. Is Doritos now irrelevant? (not in my house!)</p> 
<p>What undo pressure is upon us to be fresh and new every single day? We know that trying new things is important. We ought to have our finger on the pulse, but let’s not swing the pendulum so far as to forget why people liked us in the first place. Companies that were successful with certain strategies and products should not throw out those things purely to be ever-changing. Change is not always good if it’s based on the goal of it being done for its own sake. (New Coke anyone?)</p> 
<p>The pressure to perform is real. As business professionals, we should investigate thoroughly what the latest and greatest is. We should adopt those things that will help to deliver additional product and service offerings. We should consider how we educate our teams and our customers about our offerings. We should utilize workable resources to strengthen our marketplace position. But, we should not lose our footing just to show activity.</p> 
<p>When I was in gym class in high school, there was a classmate who would flail about wildly under the net to block the offensive shot. He did pretty well at it. It wasn’t pretty to behold, but it worked. He was then taught better how to play under the net. He was no longer as effective. His form was better, but his product (the ability to block and distract shots) suffered. What was the goal? He went from an effective weirdo to an ineffective player. He should have been left to be the first.</p> 
<p>Test why you are about to adopt a new stance, service or process. A winter finale might work for a show on the CW, but it might not make sense for CNN. Don’t adopt just because others are. The business reason should be great, the process to determine effect should be piloted and the ability to change should work forward and backward.</p> 
<p>And while your lane is wider than you think, try to stay in it. Food companies that launch dating sites purely because they can aren’t really firm in their footing. Imagine “Panera Tinder.” That might be one of the scariest swipe left or right sites – Brings a whole new meaning to “You Pick Two.”</p>

I went not knowing","2017-02-13 05:00:00","2022-05-26T21:11:23.960Z","<p>Last year, I had the privilege of being at <a href=""http://www.workhuman.com/"">WorkHuman</a>, an amazing conference on the science of happiness and recognition from Globoforce. I went not knowing fully what to expect. The conference was strong in its challenge to workplace considerations around communication, recognition and investment in others. From a few of our speakers, I found myself thinking about how I had reacted in certain situations and how I might have approached them differently. It was a little bit of regret in those considerations (which isn’t all bad), but much more about the actual outcome of the situation.</p> 
<!--more--><p>What was I hoping the outcome to be? When I lost my mind (hold the comments) at times, what result did I hope for from such a response? I had to better quantify my goals, and therefore, my behaviors, in human interaction.</p> 
<p>And from various conversations, a progression started to emerge:<br> • Being right is more important than being understood<br> • Being respected is more important than being right<br> • Being in charge is more important than being respected</p> 
<p>I didn’t care for this analysis, mostly because it rang true in my life and in the workplaces in my history.</p> 
<p>As children, we find our default position in connection with others. Few children find the right response on their own. Most find various coping mechanisms and personality traits to cover for inadequacies. The need to be right, for example, is a rough one. Growing out of that perspective simply by being told to grow out of it, does not usually work. It is not a surprise that our default is self-protection. Criticism might mean we’re wrong, and that simply won’t do, so we dig our heels in further.</p> 
<p>Fast forward to adulthood and our roles within our organizations. We endeavor to be an admired leader and seen as someone who can handle what comes our way. And yet, through a variety of circumstances, we oppose that intention through our unconscious actions.</p> 
<p>Take forgiveness, for instance. The science behind it is fascinating. The physiological responsiveness to reliving a painful or hurtful situation will still accelerate heartrate and blood pressure as well as increase stress-sweating. Because of the physical responsiveness to such situations, we may have a difficult time letting go. So, we settle into the physical, mental and emotional unhealthy pattern and direct our angst against the perpetrator of our pain.</p> 
<p>And yet, we know that forgiving another reduces the burden in our own lives. There may be people in your life who are waiting to receive the forgiveness you will offer. Even if they haven’t asked for it, offering forgiveness changes the dynamic of you and the way you relate to others. And the need to be right as a first order of business is more easily set aside in favor of restoration. Rebuilding trust and reopening doors to involvement bring about marked dynamic change for you. And, as such, an organization of people will engage differently and more productively.</p> 
<p>Being attentive to appreciation and restoration rather than justification (a healthy outcome from <a href=""http://www.workhuman.com/"">WorkHuman</a> challenges) changes perspective. The tone and demeanor of your team in one of seeking the best in others and giving others the benefit of the doubt when something seems off. And when someone does make a mistake, there isn’t as much fear in coming clean and owning it. The community will accept, redirect, and move on.</p> 
<p>Now, think about the team you have to lead. Are they free to err and to ask for forgiveness? Our default answer is yes (I see you nodding your head as you read this); however, it’s our actions that really tell the answer. Are you “done with” a certain person? Is there any bit of that feeling that you own because you’ve not really given that person a chance to recover from a past mistake? Forgiveness is actionable, not just sentiment.</p> 
<p>The efforts we’re willing to put in to protect ourselves should not supersede the efforts we put into restoring others. Confront, forgive, restore – this healthy process allows those guilty of wrong to redeem themselves and likely exceed expectations. And while I am acutely aware of those that will not rise to the occasion, I would like to submit that not all people will disappoint.</p> 
<p>Listen, those steps in the process are not easy. It hurts. You will want to be justified in your anger and pain. And you may have a right to be angry and upset. But the burden of that incident will weigh on you in this context for days, months, years, sometimes, a lifetime. Can we work together to bring the cause for humanity back to our workplaces, our homes, our lives? We must think and work human.</p>

<!--more--><p>Of course, the knee jerk is to say death because, well, you know, it’s death.&nbsp; There’s no coming back from that one and there is no course correction opportunity.&nbsp; Death takes you out of action.&nbsp; And in the timeline of the next generation, if that, most won’t think of you or know much about you.</p> 
<p>But that was just like irrelevance.&nbsp; I thought longer.&nbsp; It seemed a bit dark and cold in the irrelevant box I was envisioning.&nbsp; Words spoken, actions taken did not have a real impact on an audience of peers.</p> 
<p>Then the real consequence hit me.&nbsp; Irrelevance still commands a response.&nbsp; The lack of connection and consideration leads to outcomes that can be far-reaching and last quite a long time.&nbsp; When someone dies, a chapter ends, but when someone is irrelevant, chapters continue to be written.&nbsp; Those words might not relate to what’s really happening in our culture, whether work, home or global, but those words will land somewhere.</p> 
<p>Joss Whedon, at ComicCon 2016, had a great response to a question about commerce and creativity in movies:</p> 
<p><em>“You used to go to the movies and have no idea what you were going to see. I am actually old enough to have done this: to have gone to the local theater because something was playing. My parents would just send me by myself — rated R, it didn't matter, just get rid of him. That was the contract. I'll go see the movie, I'll open the box, I'll see what's inside. We don't do that anymore. We keep making it harder to. I have trouble watching movies after I've seen the trailer, because I've seen the movie.”</em></p> 
<p>The movie industry needs us to go see movies, especially the blockbuster budget ones.&nbsp; The cost of making them is so high that the desire for appreciation of the art form is replaced by “we’ve got to pay our backers.”&nbsp; (And funny enough, most questions that Joss got at ComicCon were about <strong>Buffy, the Vampire Slayer</strong> rather than<strong> The Avengers</strong>.&nbsp; The sleeper hit with a low budget stuck with people.)</p> 
<p>Irrelevance is a poison.&nbsp; It may not provide a one-time lethal dose; however, the long, drawn out poisoning of a culture is torture.&nbsp; Irrelevance leads to systemic brokenness for people.&nbsp; When leaders don’t have a handle on what their followers need as well as desire then they exercise their influence in futility. &nbsp;That’s when maintenance of tried and true processes, of which I have a great respect, become the goal rather than those processes supporting the overall goals.&nbsp; With this latter perspective, a leader would consistently look for what’s better – more efficient, more appealing, more cost-effective, more true to product/service development.&nbsp; And when a relevant improvement is found, it’s excitedly applied and replaces/improves something currently in use.</p> 
<p>Relevance is about thoughts and ideas as much as it’s about action and results.&nbsp; And when we don’t look to them, we can bring death to our charge.&nbsp; Irrelevance has claimed many corporate lives through the decades.&nbsp; An inability to see what matters to people, what products will help support others, and what services will bring improved quality to life leaves a company without an impact path.</p> 
<p>Check with a mentor or coach about your path.&nbsp; Simply ask the question, “Am I relevant in the work I’m doing, the decisions I’m making and the life I’m living?”&nbsp; Be ready for the response, too.&nbsp; You may not like the full answer, but receive it all at once and let it marinate for a few days.&nbsp; You’ll then be able to be more receptive of the perspective offered.</p> 
<p>So, while death closes a chapter, it might be a welcome close rather than living for chapters in an irrelevant state to those around you.&nbsp; We desire connection, confirmation and confidence.&nbsp; Irrelevance separates us from those desires on a long-term basis.&nbsp; Our footing becomes unsure and we struggle to fit.&nbsp; We legislate instead of lead.&nbsp; We marginalize instead of organize.&nbsp; We impede rather than impact.</p>

<!--more--><p>There is a very popular concept of form follows function in the architecture space.&nbsp; Simply, look at what need there is to fill or to do and then work on the form to meet that objective.&nbsp; This has and can work in other media, too. Take the very controversial movie from the early 1970’s, <strong>A Clockwork Orange</strong>.&nbsp; Stanley Kubrick wanted to provide a mind journey to challenge a post-modern world.&nbsp; He set up a world where violence and unrest were daily staples.&nbsp; He wanted to shake up the current status quo of the time by presenting an extreme view of the progression of society when left to its own devices.&nbsp; We would seek out harm, not help.&nbsp; We would settle in for torture as a mode of behavior.&nbsp; We would consider life worthless, hence the ability to disrespect it so readily.</p> 
<p>The form (the movie) was visually strange and awkward.&nbsp; The camera angles were deliberately off-center at times.&nbsp; The sets and costumes ranged from minimalistic to outlandish.&nbsp; The depiction of classical music against a backdrop of sexual frenzy and violence hurt the senses.&nbsp; Kubrick’s function (to get us to consider a world yet to be) set the course for the medium.</p> 
<p>Often, our form bespeaks of the function we are emphasizing, even unintended.&nbsp; If, for example, our person is merely meant to raise high the banner of compliance and rule-following (though important!), the form we take will show that.&nbsp; The stereotypes of a hunched-over, looking down our noses over our glasses, shallow-cheeked pencil pusher come from some level of truth.&nbsp; It resonates because we’ve seen these people before.&nbsp; We have dealt with them, sometimes all too often.</p> 
<p>And while there is nothing wrong with the form of administration, played out as a result of our function, have we adopted a perspective of our function that is too small?&nbsp; Rather, what if our function, like Kubrick, is to challenge the status quo of thought?&nbsp; What if we’re meant to push a deeper desire for connectivity amongst our teams?&nbsp; What if we’re meant to challenge success-patterned thinking?&nbsp; What form would we become?</p> 
<p>What goes into a person is the fruit he/she will produce, or as a former colleague would tell me, “Garbage in, garbage out.”&nbsp; If my form is garbage, it’s not because that was the goal.&nbsp; It’s because I adopted the function of eating garbage. &nbsp;This is why what you’re doing matters.&nbsp; If I can take stock of what I am being, then I can trace backwards from that form to the function upon which I’ve set my sights.</p> 
<p>Center yourself on the function.&nbsp; In other words, the goal for why you do what you’re doing.&nbsp; When architects and designers think through function, they consider how it will be used, how it will be held, how it will be stored, how it will fit in a home/office, how it will improve process and how it will offer support to other functions.&nbsp; From these answers, the form materializes.&nbsp; In very real ways, we can ask ourselves these same questions in our roles to figure out the form that we should take.</p> 
<p>That’s a self-check issue.&nbsp; It requires you to be honest with yourself and evaluate your role.&nbsp; You may not like it, but that’s okay.&nbsp; Even Alex in <strong>A Clockwork Orange</strong> didn’t like himself; I mean, he was morose and deviant.&nbsp; You’re not that awful!</p> 
<p>For those visual learners, draw this out.&nbsp; Answer questions about function in word and picture.&nbsp; Then depict the form you need to take to meet those necessities of function.&nbsp; Let that vision board piece motivate and encourage you.</p> 
<p>The “form follows function” concept has altered a bit in the world of architecture and design.&nbsp; The same will hold true for people development.&nbsp; But as a standard, it’s a bright spot for grounding and affirming ourselves and others.&nbsp; No violence necessary, Mr. Kubrick, to make our points.</p>

<!--more--><p>As a Star Wars aficionado, the battle for good took hold early on in life.&nbsp; Rooting for the good guys made sense.&nbsp; Add to it the power of the force and you had a winning team, however ragtag they might be.&nbsp; And while Luke Skywalker and Han Solo had flaws to work through, Princess Leia proved to be a more complicated character.&nbsp; Through the course of the franchise, she’s led the rebellion with strength, dealt with finding her real brother with love, and experienced the power of the force with openness.&nbsp; She is every bit a hero as Luke, Han, Chewy, Obi Wan and the rest.&nbsp; There was never a question that she would be.</p> 
<p>That’s part of the beauty of Star Wars.&nbsp; Each individual is looked at for what he/she brings to bear to fight for what’s right.&nbsp; Whether human, droid, wookie, etc., did not matter. &nbsp;What you can do is what mattered.</p> 
<p>There is an intention of great hope in that position.&nbsp; People rise to meet such an expectation when the context is hopeful.&nbsp; The strength found just by hearing the word “hope” is palpable.&nbsp; You can touch and feel its presence.&nbsp; And more powerfully, there is a strong wind that pours over a room when it’s believed (the force, perhaps?).</p> 
<p>Think about the power you have to bring hope to a situation.&nbsp; It takes just a few sentences and an affirmational action to change the tide of a conversation or conflict.&nbsp; It is easy to be tired of it all and to relent to the downward spiral of negativity and blame.&nbsp; Just take inventory of the residuals from the last few conflicts you’ve been a part of at work, home or elsewhere.&nbsp; What did you reap?&nbsp; Was it hopeful?</p> 
<p>Conflict isn’t the enemy if it leads to healthy outcomes.&nbsp; Just as characters in a book or movie are developed through tension, so too are you, me and our teammates.&nbsp; Growing from difficulty can deepen our resolve to succeed, our willingness to try harder and our inspiration to explore new avenues of thought and development.&nbsp; Those are all very positive; the trick is to instill hope in the midst of it.</p> 
<p>When we think the conflict is the finish, we lose out on all of those possibilities.&nbsp; And we know it.&nbsp; That’s why movies like Star Wars draw us in.&nbsp; We want to believe in the possibilities.&nbsp; We grow warm in our souls as we watch the heroes defeat evil and establish something better.&nbsp; The ideals win.</p> 
<p>And it’s important to note that this isn’t wishful thinking.&nbsp; There is a great difference between a wish and a hope, though they are commonly used interchangeably.&nbsp; &nbsp;A wish is fantasy, something not likely to occur, like winning Powerball or MegaMillions (I wish for this daily…).&nbsp; A hope is something we can see happening for real.&nbsp; There is a great possibility of it happening.</p> 
<p>In business, I hear the phrase, “I hope so” regularly when we speak about what could be.&nbsp; However, the intention behind it is usually more of a wish.&nbsp; We don’t really think it can happen.&nbsp; And the moment we think that, it’s not likely to occur, or at the very least, we won’t be a part of it coming together.&nbsp; Hope inspires us to action to ensure the success of our intention.&nbsp; A wish keeps us sitting at the windowsill looking up at the stars in fanciful delirium.</p> 
<p>I will miss Carrie Fisher portraying Princess Leia for more years to come, but the princess has given us a call to action that lives on.&nbsp; “Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You’re my only hope.”&nbsp; She had no idea who he really was and what he could do, but her call to action brought that old man out of seclusion and into battle.&nbsp; Do the same.&nbsp; Call on those around you to jump on board by sharing a vision for what will be and leading the mission to its achievement.</p> 
<p>It is a reality.&nbsp; We can live in hope.&nbsp; We are that hope.</p>

The sentimentality of the season seems to allow warmth to flow. ","2016-12-08 05:00:00","2022-05-26T21:10:27.707Z","<p>It’s usually around this time of year that we recognize and thank the heroes in our lives. The sentimentality of the season seems to allow warmth to flow. CNN does their heroes’ recognition broadcast, stationed military personnel are shown well-deserved love and kids all over our country brings coffee mugs filled with chocolates to teachers who have loved them well.</p> 
<!--more--><p>As a young child, I found great solace in PBS. Sesame Street and The Electric Company would spark my imagination and my education, but Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood would captivate me. I listened to this calming man tell me that I could do more than I thought I could, that I could be a man of conviction and passion and that I could bring a light to the world (I’m having a hard time even typing these words without my eyes welling up…darn holiday season). He set goals for me without ever using those words.</p> 
<p>He made it very simple. So, I submit to you: what do you want for next year? You’ve got to just sit down and think about what you want for next year. What do you want for you? For your team? For your department’s productivity? To bolster the whole organization? It’s just that easy to start.</p> 
<p>Of course, business climate, competition, talent resources, etc. are some of the factors that can’t be ignored. However, if the approach is proactive, you can look to see how to leverage those factors in ways that will support where you want to go. To create goals, rather, from a reactive stance to the factors is not leading, but rather responding. Again, business factors should not be ignored, but think about how your wants can be fed by the manipulation of those influences.</p> 
<p>Think, too, about the ranking of wants. It might be the most prudent business decision to lay aside one want in order for another to be achieved. Sacrifice plays a mighty hand in goal setting and accomplishment. It’s a difficult discipline to bypass low-lying fruit. Our instinctive nature will be to pluck it quickly and satisfy that want. Consider metaphorically that leaving the fruit on the tree could serve as a stepping off point to the next higher fruit on the tree. Our goals should be such that we keep our eyes on the ultimate prize rather than what we hit along the way.</p> 
<p>Further, be prepared for distractions. There will be an onslaught of items vying for your time and attention. You’ve got fight them off if they don’t help push an agenda. BUT, be smart to take a moment to evaluate those distractions. Could they serve to show you that your goals are off or out of touch? Maybe the reason why certain distractions come up is because there is a systemic issue. Don’t avoid the reality that you don’t know everything; there may be circumstances at play that you had not factored into your goals. Recalibrate along the way.</p> 
<p>And finally, sit in a quiet place to reflect and generate. Leave your office, your cubicle, the business grounds and go sit somewhere undisturbed to give these goals the attention they deserve. They set a tone for your behavior and your marching orders that affect so many. It’s okay to be attentive to them, free from interference. Your mind needs to be clear and focused in your assessment time. You might walk into that time with a few goals in mind, but you might walk out of that time with very different ones.</p> 
<p>Mr. Rogers once said, “Little by little, we human beings are confronted with situations that give us more and more clues that we aren’t perfect.” It’s unlikely that we’ll just knee-jerk our way into developing healthy objectives for ourselves, our teams and our businesses. Our ability to be imperfect shouldn’t be something we mask, but something we proactively address. In goal setting, implementing a disciplined approach might help us to frame it well.</p> 
<p>In light of the season…Thank you, Mr. Rogers.</p>

<!--more--><p>In the great American classic, <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">A Night at the Roxbury</span>, there is a tough scene where the amazingly hip brother duo of Steve and Doug, played by Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan, fall apart in their relationship. &nbsp;They recognize the disappointment in each other and project anger. &nbsp;The faux-punching and name-calling ensue. &nbsp;They battle frustration due to an overall lack of purpose and direction. &nbsp;It spills over into their attitude about everything they do...even the head-bobbing.</p> 
<p>As human resources and management professionals, we hear these sentiments fairly regularly. &nbsp;Perhaps end of year budgeting mixed with the difficulty of the holiday season makes things a bit tougher. &nbsp;Those people might become fraught with anxiety. &nbsp;Fear is a powerful attack on the heart and mind, and quite often, the defender of the attack has little training on how to do fight back.</p> 
<p>Whether it's a behavior modification tactic or a mindfulness-based approach, there are coping mechanisms available. &nbsp;Most organizations do not spend the effort or money being proactive in introducing such mechanisms, but rather scurry to plan reactive meetings with each individual who expresses such pain and fear. &nbsp;There is a cost benefit analysis to be done to show the worthiness of a proactive initiative.</p> 
<p>It's rather easy to determine the costs that implementing a program with a series of training initiatives, facility space rental, refreshments, etc. will be. &nbsp;Most of those costs are fixed and will likely not vary much from initial agreement or contract. &nbsp;The other end of the analysis is a bit trickier. &nbsp;Think about items such as the impact to customer service, production time, the quality of workmanship, market penetration opportunities and reputation management. &nbsp;There are actual financial benefits to addressing fear and uncertainty. &nbsp;Our employees typically represent our greatest line item under liabilities, so consider that placement in determining whether offering such coping mechanism options are worth it.</p> 
<p>There is a great soapbox to stand upon and tout the ""ridiculousness"" of offering such support from the workplace. &nbsp;All arguments are not awful and the philosophies are not necessarily misguided. &nbsp;The workplace isn't a babysitter, a therapist or a doctor, but it does find itself in those situations due the current environment. &nbsp;Homes are fractured, people are dealing with financial ruin, disease is ravaging our communities, and more. &nbsp;The people who live those realities are working in our factories and offices. &nbsp;What do you think they can do with those truths? &nbsp;Keep them bottled up for 8-10 hours per day?</p> 
<p>Shed light on it. &nbsp;Good culture is built upon health, so poor culture is built upon what? &nbsp;Whether you're saying fear, uncertainty, communication issues, etc., it is un-health and it translates into an impact on our companies. &nbsp;It's no wonder that our management staff is being called upon to respond to life's fears. &nbsp;Just as any process impairment would be addressed on a manufacturing line, so too, should any personnel impairment, which does impact production and service provision. &nbsp;Get the right tools out to the people that need it.</p> 
<p>Invest in some training for management as well as some offerings for staff. &nbsp;Many organizations have access to such support through brokerages, insurance carriers or local professional organizations. &nbsp;A company may not even know that an opportunity is in the arsenal; check your policies and your affinity groups.</p> 
<p>At the end of the day, everybody has some level of hurt going on. &nbsp;The manifestation of such hurt can vary. &nbsp;As human resources and management professionals can attest, staff carry some heavy burdens that others might have no clue about. &nbsp;We can provide an outlet to deal with such truths for our people and to encourage a healthy approach to work.</p> 
<p>Imagine looking out over the manufacturing floor or cubicle village to the well-adjusted staff bobbing their heads to the uplifting music in their heads. &nbsp;Success? &nbsp;I think so.</p>

I can’t believe that the best we can do with the power of the internet is fill it with cats in various poses and outfits. I did, however, see a video recently where a cat who was raised on a show horse farm trotted along the property as if she were in competition. This cat would raise her knees high and keep her head forward. It was pretty remarkable to see how much she was influenced by her environment.</p> 
<!--more--><p>Consequently, it got me thinking about our ability to assimilate. And while this has nothing to do with show horse competition (my knees don’t raise as high as they once did…darn long jump), it has everything to do with influence. The cat in that video did not have to be instructed to mimic the horses in training. She observed and assimilated her behavior to match. There is likely not a need that this cat is filling with such training, other than a social media desire for a million likes, but there is a lesson for us.</p> 
<p>Assimilation can be both a positive and a negative. Consider peer pressure. It is usually delivered in a negative context. Parents want to keep their kids from those that would lead them down a negative or wrong road. We want them to avoid those situations where peer pressure takes over, leading to drinking, drugs, crime, etc. We want them to choose well. Perhaps having a friend group that wants to pursue the same type of good choices is a sort of peer pressure opportunity. When one of that group wants to choose poorly, their friends motivate, tease and remind them of why that choice is dumb. Peer pressure can work both ways.</p> 
<p>In our work environments, isn’t this true as well? Staff assimilate to their surroundings. If there is a “don’t work too hard” mentality that most staff follow, then a new addition to the team, however awesome the work history had been, is likely to assimilate to the unspoken request of co-workers. It’s observed. It is understood that this is just how things are.</p> 
<p>Understand, too, that assimilation does not have to mean a forfeiting of individuality. The creative contribution, personal experiences and innovative outlets that each person brings should be shared and used. That can be the mark of what it means to assimilate in your organization - everyone has made a commitment to offer, invest and engage in the community for the good of the whole. The Rat Pack, for example, didn't minimize each individual's giftedness, but rather they found a way to affirm strengths and assimilate as one cohesive entertainment experience. The difficulty of the social environment in terms of race, religion and heritage did not thwart their ability to engage the public. In many ways, the Rat Pack caused their audiences to assimilate to a new reality, at least during their performances. The display of such an integration isn't going to be the same for each group of people, but the overall commitment to it should be similar.</p> 
<p>Our leadership can and should drive change in this area. It’s not a pipe dream or a warm &amp; fuzzy movement, but rather a business necessity. Turnover may very well be connected to a poor environment that an individual cannot assimilate to. The assimilation may have much to do with an inability to make a difference or a contribution of substance. Certainly someone can move one stack of papers to another stack. The tasks may be basically completed, for instance, but the drive for more is not explored and encouraged. By and large, people will rise to the expectation that’s laid out. If we don’t lay out something bigger, then don’t be surprised that the culture feels sluggish or entitled.</p> 
<p>Assimilation needs to start with a few. Gather a couple to yourself and pour into them. If something is wrong with the environment, a memo to all won’t cut it. Think of it like a diet. Just holding yourself accountable to what not to eat isn’t enough; it’s a matter of understanding and holding yourself accountable to what you should eat. Offer the alternative and maintain that offering. Behavior will change through that consistency. It will become habit and influence the environment.</p> 
<p>An assimilation to healthy culture, process and contribution is a positive. Helping them see how they fit, how they contribute and how the team functions cohesively through it are worthy goals. That's an assimilation. It’s something that you can start to do today by rallying those few around these goals. It’s a conquerable task. Be visual about it to your team. Let them join you in painting a picture of the end game.</p> 
<p>Maybe even video best practices. Let those few help to start a momentum through various creative media outlets. I mean, we could always use more cat videos, right?</p>

<!--more--><p>Lots of locker room talk consideration over the past couple of weeks in light of the Donald Trump hot mic bus recordings being released.&nbsp; He and Billy Bush quickly established a “buddy” relationship.&nbsp; And while, the majority of response has been to condemn the words along with sentiment and systemic treatment of women, it would be unwise to consider it in such a small context.&nbsp; Trump’s words have been repeated in locker rooms since I was old enough to change for gym class right up through board rooms since I was experienced enough to have an executive role.</p> 
<p>Period movies and television shows from the 50’s and early 60’s show the dichotomy of family life and business life.&nbsp; The male character is a member of the 1<sup>st</sup> Baptist or Presbyterian church in town with his wife and kids; they raise their kids to be good Americans, respectful students and to be seen and not heard.&nbsp; At work, that same male may participate in an affair with his secretary, in shady business dealings to undercut another within the company, and in drinks at 3PM to discuss work and women with his boss.&nbsp; Very stereotypical, I know, but much of the content and context in those period dramas.</p> 
<p>Our audience is no longer known by look alone.&nbsp; White boys chatting it up about a woman’s anatomy and ability to score isn’t an inclusive strategy for corporate culture.&nbsp; You cannot make a decision just based upon look as our workplace is no longer a homogeneous pool.&nbsp; And further, those who do look the same as you aren’t necessarily coming from the same background as you.&nbsp; It’s a whole new world.&nbsp; And whether it’s Donald Trump on a bus or Bill Clinton on a golf course, any commentary based upon those assumptions is more than unwise; it’s deadly to our culture.</p> 
<p>In the small kingdoms we manage in our workplaces, we may not be able to change the world, but we can influence one sphere.&nbsp; Of course, the liability around harassment is evident.&nbsp; It’s not okay to allow language that demeans and cheapens another, whether based on sex, race, religion, medical history, orientation or age, to permeate a workplace.&nbsp; It’s illegal, if not federally, then likely on a state level.&nbsp; You have a responsibility to protect the company you represent.&nbsp; Work for change to minimize such liability.</p> 
<p>And yet, as people we may have a deeper responsibility than merely the law.&nbsp; What are we telling the future about us?&nbsp; Our ability to engage at this level is just what a role in management and in human resources should be focused upon.&nbsp; Process improvement, sales objectives and growth planning are necessary and the core duty for some of you.&nbsp; Don’t disregard those needs.&nbsp; Yet, those strategies and duties can be offered in a better context.</p> 
<p>The drum beating for employee engagement is loud.&nbsp; To what are we asking them to engage?&nbsp; Our company?&nbsp; OK.&nbsp; So, what is our company like?&nbsp; Do you really want them to be engaged in and to it?&nbsp; Think of it as you might a romantic relationship.&nbsp; As things progress, your love interest gets to see your quirks about washing dishes, doing laundry, cleaning, grocery shopping, etc. &nbsp;This person, also, experiences you more fully, warts and all.&nbsp; That relationship will likely require you to change some things – maybe you need to make the bed, to put your dishes in the dishwasher instead of the sink, to throw out your porn.&nbsp; Whatever you need to do, you may do to make the environment for your relationship bloom and grow more.</p> 
<p>Those same considerations at the workplace should occur (If you have porn at the workplace…yikes.&nbsp; Let’s talk offline).&nbsp; What is the willingness of the executive team to sacrifice to allow the relationship of the company and its employees to bloom and grow?&nbsp; If it’s locker room talk that needs to be addressed, then let it go.&nbsp; Don’t make excuses for it.&nbsp; Uncover biases and systemic limiters, and then remove them.&nbsp; Inclusivity is a popular term, and a respectable one, but to what are we including people?&nbsp; Once they see it, they may not want to be included.&nbsp; What a sad possibility.&nbsp; But it’s correctable.</p> 
<p>It’s important to remember that this is not about politics.&nbsp; That may have been the most recent context we’re seeing, but it’s not the only environment where such a lack of care about people is evident.&nbsp; Our workplaces may be run by locker room talking, “real housewives” attitude-mongering, bulldozing leaders. &nbsp;Confront it. &nbsp;Categorizing people or a person in an unhealthy or demeaning manner is unacceptable.&nbsp; Act upon it and work for change.</p> 
<p>My life is full of strong women, Christians, disabled individuals, gay men, multi-cultural heritages and races. &nbsp;I like them each individually.&nbsp; And though I may look like you, please don’t come to me to share in a negative view or a demeaning approach regarding any of them or what they “represent.”&nbsp; It’s not funny.</p>

<!--more--><p>When Lucy and Ethel go to work in that classic chocolate-making production episode, their rating was pretty poor. &nbsp;They over-exaggerated their abilities, they could not keep up with the line, they ate product while working and they tried to cover up their errors. &nbsp;They were fired on their first day.</p> 
<p>From a television rating perspective, this episode started <a href=""http://www.ranker.com/list/best-i-love-lucy-episodes/reference?&amp;var=4"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Season 2</a> with a bang. &nbsp;It capitalized off of the ground-breaking work of the first season and set the tone for television sitcoms for decades to come, to this day. &nbsp;The ratings for their work was at the highest levels.</p> 
<p>So how do you give thought around context in order to frame the content? &nbsp;A relevant evaluative process is more likely to give credibility to the results in the eyes of the employee, even when those results are less than excellent.</p> 
<p><b>Tactical</b> - What is the hands on level of engagement into the organization's health? &nbsp;Look at how the employee puts his/her time and talents into the company. &nbsp;And, then be able to point to the result of such tactics. &nbsp;Is there an organizational influence? &nbsp;And while business bottom-line is the easiest metric to use, it limits our view. &nbsp;For example, a survey might reveal that most employees feel comfortable in the workplace. &nbsp;Find out why. &nbsp;It may be because the front desk receptionist greets everyone warmly and genuinely. &nbsp;It might be that he/she acknowledges others specifically for achievements, birthdays, tough times, etc. That person contributes to organizational health, despite the lack of a straight line to net profits. &nbsp;That person has a line. &nbsp;Look harder.</p> 
<p><b>Experiential</b> - How has the employee involved himself/herself in the company? &nbsp;What have they experienced, either voluntarily or involuntarily? &nbsp;Consider both causes. &nbsp;Just because someone volunteers to do something, doesn't mean it was good for anyone involved (and yes, you can fire someone from a volunteer role...). &nbsp;Maybe there are new processes initiated by an employee's willingness to try. &nbsp;As such, they've been added to a workflow or perhaps replaced a previous workflow. &nbsp;But just as important, maybe an employee rallied his/her department to participate in a walk for a particular disease-fighting organization. &nbsp;Those experiences should not be lost if they don't fit into a clean bucket for the company's review pattern. &nbsp;Go back to considering what those experiences have done for the organization.</p> 
<p><b>Emotional</b> - Odd, right? &nbsp;We have so many emotionally-stunted people working in our industries that it's important to think through this. &nbsp;Listen, hugs and kisses aren't what's really meant by emotional (although, I have been a good receiver of that type of love for years...don't stop!). &nbsp;Emotion is tied to communication, critical thinking and behavior. &nbsp;Do they not matter in a consideration of performance? &nbsp;There is a great deal of teasing regarding millennials and their lack of consistent approach. ""There's a stop sign ahead, but if you don't feel that the stop sign applies to you, then do what you think you should do. &nbsp;Don't stop if you don't feel you should. &nbsp;It's okay."" &nbsp;That perspective is not exclusive to one generation. &nbsp;I still talk to some 60 year-old business executives who haven't figured out emotional health and they struggle to connect well with staff. &nbsp;That's not good for business.</p> 
<p><b>Social</b> - How has community been fostered by this employee? &nbsp;So many companies talk about how they're a family. &nbsp;That invokes an employee's context about family. &nbsp;What if my family is a bunch of narcissistic, inconsiderate, selfish jerks? (This is just an example, it's not a reflection on anyone in my family so please, Mom, don't text me and send me angry-faced emojis). &nbsp;The consideration should be about fostering supportive, interpersonal relationships for the movement of the organization and for the building up of others. &nbsp;Look at how an employee engages with his/her teammates. &nbsp;Speak to dynamism, collaboration and group ingenuity. &nbsp;That takes risk for each employee willing to be engaged at that level and we should be mindful of that healthy impact.</p> 
<p>Of course, I know, that you have a performance review form that has many more areas to consider. But maybe, those other areas should be considered in this expanded context. &nbsp;Haven't you heard, ""But you don't know"" from employees defending themselves from a manager's perspective? &nbsp;Sure you have. &nbsp;So, why is it that we don't know? &nbsp;Looking holistically as well as specifically takes time, I get it, but it's the best way to consider talent.</p> 
<p>Quite frankly, we don't have an never-ending supply of ready-to-wear talent. This type of consideration will enhance how we can better setup our staff for success through skill development, knowledge management and attitude improvement while reducing our turnover.</p> 
<p>If your manager sat with you to review your performance and began to share a limited view of your impact, you would want to say, ""But you don't know."" &nbsp;Think about your staff saying that to you and be ready to offer the fuller context in light of the above areas. &nbsp;Let them know that you do know.</p>

<!--more--><p>Lots of shows have been categorized by their ""jumping the shark"" moments.&nbsp; Often, you’ll notice the decline based upon set changes, character additions or subtractions, character job changes, etc.&nbsp; A common approach is when an unexpected birth or addition of a child occurs in an effort to add years to a show.&nbsp; As a kid, a string of this thinking occurred: Oliver from ""The Brady Bunch"", Sam from ""Diff'rent Strokes"", Andy from ""Family Ties"", Chrissy from ""Growing Pains""...need I go on?&nbsp; You would be hard-pressed to find a time when this has worked well for a show.</p> 
<p>Similarly, you would be hard-pressed to find it working for companies.&nbsp; For example, when companies decide that their products need to have a ""smart"" feature, is it just so that it connects to our phones and therefore is relevant?&nbsp; Why do I need to check my phone to see if the pan I've placed on the stove is hot enough? Seriously, that's a thing.&nbsp; In an effort to seem relevant, companies will sometimes gravitate blindly towards trends.&nbsp; This does not make a company viable.&nbsp; In fact, it might lead to the opposite (and often does).</p> 
<p>And within some of our companies, we’ve jumped the shark.&nbsp; The life support has been turned on for a department within your organization.&nbsp; How did we get to this place?&nbsp; HR, for example, often lives in fear that their department will be cut in some way.&nbsp; And while it is not uncommon for HR to be one of the departments to experience a RIF if the time comes, does it happen because of a self-fulfilling prophecy?&nbsp; If I think no one will ask me to the prom, I am likely walking around as if no one will ask me to the prom.&nbsp; Those sad people will end up home on prom night sulking and eating a half gallon of ice cream while watching The Notebook on demand (this is what I’ve heard happens…I did not experience this, I swear).&nbsp; HR can suffer from such an esteem issue.</p> 
<p>Perhaps our department is trying to add more to what we do out of desperation for our leadership to see us as relevant.&nbsp; We don’t sit home and eat ice cream, but rather, we explode into employee engagement – incentivizing, surveying, programizing.&nbsp; We believe that this is the level of visible relevance we need to show.&nbsp; See, we’re busy and we matter.&nbsp; Can we get a contract for another 12 episodes, please?&nbsp; Longevity does not mean impact.&nbsp; This is a hard reality.&nbsp; We believe, deep down, that if we last, we’re relevant.</p> 
<p>That is not true.</p> 
<p>Our relevance comes from true, measurable impact in our organizations.&nbsp; What is it we actually offer and fulfill?&nbsp; What is the business bottom line that we're impacting?&nbsp; What's been our effect on process, service or sales?&nbsp; And while the latest and greatest may not be the route to go, how do you know?&nbsp; Study the trends.&nbsp; Understand fit.&nbsp; Consider philosophy.&nbsp; Take action.</p> 
<p>The challenge of knowing our people well - skills, aptitudes - is a vital offering that we can bring.&nbsp; Proactively look for ways to make that priority happen.&nbsp; From there, you can reference those results against the performance outcomes.&nbsp; Measuring process and results are a universal language that require no posturing.</p> 
<p>Shake off the demons of feigned relevance.&nbsp; They don't define success, nor do they define you.&nbsp; Start attacking the work in front of you with passion and use the skills that have been dormant for a bit.&nbsp; Assess what's working, what's not, develop a plan, gather resources and act out of greatness.</p>

<p>And therein, is the rub. Maybe they don’t see it anymore, if ever. Maybe it’s what you used to do, but you’ve become as complacent as you accuse your team of being. It’s often subtle. You don’t wake up one morning and decide to be less dedicated. Rather, you might have allowed the tiredness of the path traveled to dictate your next moves. And while it was only to be for a day, it’s now three months or three years later and the effects are being felt by your team. They are now responding to what they’re experiencing.</p> 
<p>My long time love, Molly Ringwald, in Pretty in Pink sits on her bed with Duckie (Jon Cryer). She shares with him her hope that she’s not the only one who knows how incredible he is. Duckie’s sad response is “Well, at this point in time, I’m afraid you are, honey.”</p> 
<p>It’s easy to blame you, right? I mean, you’re the manager and everything stops with you. Your boss barges into your office and demands results and explanations. Your staff has been barging in demanding resources and complaining about you, the team, the work, etc. You have it tough. But you know what? That comes with the territory. You’re a manager. Manage it.</p> 
<p>Strong words, but necessary.</p> 
<p>Advancement is desired. The mainstream talent management conversation is about succession planning and doing it quickly. 26-year old employees are looking to be CEO next year, if you believe every article written about it, and you can’t let that time get away from you to make it happen. Removing the tongue from the cheek, an active, vibrant talent culture is one of collaboration, constant improvement and competency assessment and utilization. Bringing less than our “A” game opens a door for staff to look outside of the department, at the very least, if not outside of the company.</p> 
<p>And while, this perspective is one for a three-day conference, a realistic first step is to sit down and ask yourself what you’ve done for your team lately. Don’t allow rose-colored glasses of past sacrifices and engagements to color what you’re doing (or not doing) today. I know you were the hero for the team in 2014, but it’s two years later. That’s plenty of time to be forgotten, or at least, to be less impactful.</p> 
<p>Every day is a day to crush it. That’s not a pithy slogan. That’s a business imperative. The list is long and depressing of those companies that have closed or are a shell of what they used to be due to poor management and leadership. And for almost all of them, what occurred was not a one-day issue. The choices (or lack thereof) made did not align with the business mandate and were not delivered in a context for staff to understand.</p> 
<p>Manage messaging as much as process and output. Think about what you’re doing and act upon it. While thinking is very important, it isn’t always a visible example to the team. You sitting at your desk may not equate to an employee observing to self, “Oh, look at my awesome manager. She is sitting at her desk looking at her computer. I bet she’s considering staff morale and process improvement. She’s so awesome. I’m lucky to have her.” Truth be told, it’s possible that’s what the manager might be doing at that moment, but it’s hard to know it as an observer. Balance obnoxious bragging with informed considerate disclosure in conversation with your team. Fill them in and deliver on what you’ve been contemplating.</p> 
<p>The success of the past is just that. It’s in the past. Today, deliver something else. The responsiveness from your staff will become what you desire it to be. You’ll be setting a new tone or recovering a tone that once was. The highway of complaining is replaced by one of vibrant complimenting. Talent will know what can be done, who can do it and how it helps the whole.</p> 
<p>Get up, hit the video below, shake your groove thing and think through a plan for yourself. Today is that day. As Janet says, “Soap opera says you’ve got one life to live.”</p>

Not all of us live in ","2016-08-24 04:00:00","2022-05-26T21:08:42.491Z","<p>When summer wraps up, there is something tangibly ending in our lives. So much effort and energy are spent prepping for this season. Not all of us live in the eternal sunshine states of Florida, California and the like, so summer is a big deal! As an east coast resident, the three months of summer are gold. Lots of effort goes into how to best spend those 3 months (really, it’s 2.5, but I’m rounding up!). Day trips, evening patio dinners, weekend excursions, 7-day vacations, etc. are scheduled. We don’t want it to end.</p> 
<!--more--><p>Danny and Sandy spent their summer swimming (Sandy almost drowned!), holding hands, staying out late and making out (Sandy tells it differently than Danny on this point). Their weeks of summer were the best ever, but alas, summer ended and school was upon them. Sandy had to go back to her faraway home and Danny back to his T-Birds.</p> 
<p>In the business community, it’s easy to romanticize our off-site meetings or team getaways. We build them up like the summer days that Danny and Sandy had. We set that time as the goal. And just as those crazy love bird teens found out, the destination isn’t the goal. For our organizations, the destination can be the annual sales celebration meeting in the Bahamas or the executive leadership team getaway to the Cayman Islands. Those are amazing destinations and they are certainly more appealing than a frozen tundra (unless you prefer freezing your tookus off).</p> 
<p>Listen, get me on that plane! But the trip doesn’t last. For some of us, we know better. We get that the location is valuable, but it’s not the end. We, instead, focus on what we’ll do once we’re there. We redo mission statements; we plan incredible team building exercises; we bring in fabulous speakers to encourage and motivate our teams. Those are great things! So much planning goes into them and the hope for a return is desired.</p> 
<p>And yet, therein may be the rub. When we get back to work, what happens? Is the pattern of normal living returned to? When Danny went back to Rydell High School, he donned his leather jacket, put the cigarette in his mouth and entertained the ladies. The “time of his life” that he experienced over the summer was a memory.</p> 
<p>Perhaps much of the effort should be put into what the outcomes will be. Yes, make the time memorable, but the post-trip time should be just as memorable.</p> 
<p>This applies to on-site excursions, too. Those fantastic programs you put together. The speakers you’ve brought in. The launch event that marketing spent weeks on. All of that is valuable, but it's not the end. The leadership for the company, or at least for the division, should be involved in planning for post-trip. More than one person will need to hold people accountable to the application or implementation from the event. The team should be decided ahead of time upon the objectives as well as how to measure them. This is effort, yes, but it's effort that justifies the ROI of such programs.</p> 
<p>Think about marriage. So much time is spent planning for the wedding day. Dress, flowers, photographer, venue, etc. It’s all so important. Months of planning are done. What if that were it? What if at the end of the reception or honeymoon, the newly married couple says, “That was fun. We should plan another one of these again. Take care and hope to see you soon.” Each of them returns to his/her walk of life prior to being married. As observers, we would likely think that they’re crazy. They just got married…it’s more than a wedding.</p> 
<p>That same logic holds true to the programs, events and conferences we help organize. Think long-term for your team. Don’t be enthralled with the “wedding” alone. Think of the “marriage.” The event won’t have to end; it will live on in its application.</p>

Which is right? I’ve had managers defend their stance to me in various contexts and situations. And there are times I’ve agreed with them and there are times I’ve not. There are times I’ve had to ask them what they were thinking (a question I have regretted asking upon occasion because they’ve told me).</p> 
<!--more--><p>Whose perspective gets to win out and why? Is it just based upon how we’re feeling? If so, that has to stop. </p> 
<p>Often, the person with the most power gets to win. The executive, the c-suite, the board of directors...one of them can pull ahead in the winning viewpoint rather easily. The trick might just be to work with this level in understanding the winning perspective as well as influencing it. </p> 
<p>Remember that freshman year of Psych 101? One of the many classic truths taught was that people want to be heard and validated. Our need to belong and to contribute runs deep. When people, especially when they sit on the decision-making team, don’t feel that they can do or be these things, they leave, attack or, perhaps the worst, die inside. We can influence someone who is ready to settle for one of these options.</p> 
<p>Perhaps it might be a worthy exercise to provide some case studies to the executive team, leaving out the resolution, in order to foster discussion between them. Why wait until there is a real situation to find out which opinion will win? And from here, understand and influence such an opinion, where appropriate. </p> 
<p>If someone has the opportunity to share his/her perspective and to be heard in a safe environment, then the defenses are lowered. A time for conversation and for consideration is easier to foster. It’s here that those details which are illegal or morally questionable can be vetted thoroughly by those decision-makers. It’s here that previous experiences can be shared to offer clarity around a particular perspective. It’s here that the cause of the organization can be upheld stronger so that the decisions made are broader in context.</p> 
<p>The natural question that arises here is, “Who decides who is right?” Well, that’s where the forum matters so much. Our ability to foster dialogue is crucial; however, if we cannot do this in an environment where the sharing of thoughts can happen, it will not produce the desired results. Our impact is based upon the results that come from such a time. With the end in mind, it behooves us to ensure that the environment is healthy for dialogue. Remember, just being able to express a view and for it to be heard clearly is a large part of the battle. </p> 
<p>But, it must be understood, that there may be a divide between positions. There will have to be an ultimate decision made. Respect for the next steps of those individuals on the opposing side should be offered. If someone feels so strongly about an opinion that he/she needs to leave the organization, then that’s okay. You’ve established an environment for that person to share the different view, as well as to be heard. Being heard is not the same as full agreement. We help cultivate maturity through situations like this.</p> 
<p>This is not wishful thinking, by the way. I’ve sat in board meetings where perspectives and opinions were being shared. People were being heard, but these people were also the hearers of others’ expressed opposite viewpoints. It’s not about making everyone think the same. Group think has lots of issues to contend with, too. This is about readying your team to act when it needs to. This is about ensuring a path towards an appropriate response in situations. This is about allowing each other to find out where the edges have to be smoothed out or where they need to be left sharp.</p> 
<p>In Mommie Dearest, Faye Dunaway portrays Joan Crawford. It’s an ugly look into the movie star’s life and her influence on her children. There is one ancillary scene towards the end of Joan’s life where her husband, Al Steele, has died and left her with his seat on the board for Pepsi Cola. She attends the first meeting afterwards only to be patronized by the remaining all-male board and “kindly” offered to be excused. It was the first time a woman had been on the board. The men did not know how to respond and had not worked through it ahead of time. They were made to feel ridiculous and she offered a solid perspective on it that they could not dispute, but only to welcome her onto the board.</p> 
<p>And while there are laws today which would prevent what Joan Crawford went through, there are still plenty of perspectives out there. Someone has to listen to them, to understand them, to challenge them, even if it’s just to be prepared with a response as to why it’s the way it is. Oh, and “because I said so” is not a thoughtful response or position. Just in case that’s what your plan was.</p>

We fight it everyday. When we are faced with it, what is our normal response? Walk away? Join in? Yikes.</p> 
<!--more--><p>Kit, the pitcher in A League of Their Own, is negative throughout most of the movie. Manufacturing sympathy for her is tough. She is a whiner. She brings down those around her. She is frustrated with the sister who seems to have everything. She is obnoxious to her teammates. She is negative about her life and wants to bring others down around her.</p> 
<p>Think about how critical the pitcher is to the team. What does it do to the team to have someone like this at the mound? How many of these people work with or for us? And while you might want to fight this person, just as happens in one scene of the movie, work policy is likely to prohibit you from doing so. </p> 
<p>Confrontation is appropriate. You do not need to allow this person to monopolize your time or to jeopardize the flow of the rest of the team due to such negativity. It is not okay.</p> 
<p>Make the business case first. Log the hours given in support of this negative person, to try to move him/her beyond the perceived issues. Log the hours given in support of correction of the frustrated team communication. Log the hours given in conversation with other team members who struggle to work with that negative person. Those hours have a cost, with very little ROI. </p> 
<p>Often the pattern for a manager is to have all of these conversations, but the functional team dynamic remains the same. The cycle of engagement is not impacted and the status quo returns a day after addressing the issue. Management does little usually to course-correct the department. The symptom gets address – frustration, lack of communication, hurt feelings – but the cause – the negativity of a person – is left because we don’t know what to do.</p> 
<p>Sit with Mr./Ms. Negative and share the logged hours. Show him/her how much time has been spent because of him/her. Let the time be a factual example that the behavior has caused. You’re not saying the classic, “I spend so much time dealing with your stuff.” That’s too general and will likely cause the negative employee to be remorseful for a moment but with no lasting repercussion. When management is specific to the time, a line can be drawn in the sand to say enough.</p> 
<p>A manager should further make the business case regarding lack of productivity. In all of the hours spent by the manager in dealing with the situations caused by the negativity, rest assured it’s about the same for the team members involved. They are not on task because of having to address the related issues of the negativity. And every member of the team is valuable. It should be very easy to show the negative employee that the team is not here to deal with these issues; it’s not part of their job description. The cost of lost productivity is real and can be shared as an amount based upon time, hourly rate, cost of goods, and other operational &amp; production costs. </p> 
<p>Giving the negative person truth and fact is the most respectful way to engage. It will allow the conversation to move away from feeling, which is the default position, and rest purely on fact. Management must engage on a level that moves the negative person out of his/her own perspective and into one that includes the company’s purpose. Often, the negative individual sees his/her role as unappreciated at the company. By sharing factual information, the negative person is offered a different (and more correct) view of how the company sees him/her. When confronted with such information, management can be deliberate about the path of engagement moving forward.</p> 
<p>Management will need to follow through on this. If we’re serious that the waste of time is enough, then we must act upon that. No more resources of time, team members and operational productivity will be wasted on such negativity. Everything isn’t terrible, everything isn’t against you and everything isn’t about you. Clearly act on this.</p> 
<p>And while management may feel that the negative person is too tough to handle, a better view is to think about the team members that aren’t receiving such attention despite the great work being done. The squeaky wheel getting the grease isn’t a long-term strategy for success. Affirm the right behaviors more than the wrong; look at the time you’re spending on the wrong and make corrections.</p> 
<p>Keep in mind, too, that this negative person can follow the path that Kit did. She got traded. Don’t wait too long to trade your Kit.</p>

Once or twice a week, I am on a train. When I hop a train to New York City, I find a person or two with this tenacity around seating. These people would sooner cut you than have you sit next to them. They put their briefcase or purse on the seat next to them. Fearful people walk by the open seat for fear of reprisal from the presumed bold person who would dare hold the seat with baggage. I have watched a passenger stand by the seat, look down at the purse, look over at the owner seated next to it (who never looks up, to the right or to the left), and then walk on. Where is the resolve?</p> 
<!--more--><p>For those who’ve traveled with me, you could attest to the fact that I am of the type to board the train, pick up the baggage on the open seat, hand it over to the owner and sit happily for the remainder of the ride. Only once did I have the baggage owner say something to me. I did not look up, to the left or to the right. I consoled myself with the thought of throwing momma from the train (probably the only positive context I can offer from that movie). I exude resolve in that kind of circumstance.</p> 
<p>This trait is not found in all people naturally. It is, however, something that can be learned. Tenacity is grown from a response to a core belief. In the previous example, fairness is violated. If fairness or justice or a sense of right and wrong matter to you, that can be built upon to develop tenacity around defending such a position or offering active engagement to its display. It’s a manifestation of your belief system.</p> 
<p>Think about your goals for this year. It’s halfway through the year. Do you still believe in them? Take some time to measure where you’ve gotten with them and what’s needed to accomplish these goals. But also, assess the tenacity with which you’ve approached the path towards those goals. Do you fight for them? Is your resolve deep around them?</p> 
<p>Goals are important. For as much as they’ve been over-complicated in creation, the point of them remains strong. Goals serve as a beacon. They are to drive the daily strain. They allow for mile-markers of celebration on the path towards them. They are the driving force of an organization. If you don’t know where you want to go, then where are we going?</p> 
<p>Being strong in our resolve towards these goals takes an unapologetic position. Unapologetic is not the same as mean. Be tenacious in protecting those goals, even if there is an alteration that has to happen to them. Updating goals based upon new information is healthy. If the new information is that you’re tired or it’s too hard, that is not healthy. Goals should be designed to stretch you. Easy to say, yes, but the point is to work hard to get this challenging objective.</p> 
<p>If you want to increase sales by 50%, calls will have to be made, networking will be expanded, pitching product and services will have to increase 100%, etc. All of this takes great effort. If you are not committed to the goal, then tenacity around it won’t develop. Come back to goal creation. Where do you want to get to and why? Answer that clearly and create objectives to get there.</p> 
<p>For those who are privileged to lead a team, work with each individual to develop strong resolve around the goals set. Help them to know how to get to where they’d like to be. Avoid the common issue of goals being set to paper, and then little else. You have a great chance to enhance and develop skill sets for your team. And then the celebration around accomplishment is even sweeter when it’s a collaborative effort of support and encouragement.</p> 
<p>Fight more for the goals you’ve set. Don’t cower. Stand up and move towards accomplishment of those goals. Remain laser-focused. If someone has put a piece of luggage in your seat, move it. You paid for your ticket. You were up early to get the train. You have a goal to get to the destination ahead. See? Think about goal-pursuit in simpler ways; it will help to foster tenacity. And once you have the resolve behind the goals, watch out world!</p>

Remember when Billy Madison got to do all 12 years of school over again? He challenged his father to let him redo each grade from 1st to 12th for two weeks per grade. The goal was for Billy to show that he can work hard on his own, and therefore, be qualified to take over the family business. And as a gibberish-speaking, Nintendo-playing, flaming bag of doggie poo lighting, raging drunk, that was going to be quite a feat.</p> 
<!--more--><p>Now perhaps you work for such a company owner. Maybe, like Billy, your leader beat the odds and somehow ended up in the leader seat, despite having to wear loafer or Velcro shoes only due to an inability to tie a shoelace. Maybe you’re wishing for your own do-over, or least the quickest escape.</p> 
<p>We both know that repairing the mistakes of others is an uphill climb. It’s exhausting and it’s deflating to the soul. Better would be to have a prevention plan in place and work from proactivity. But this is for another blog….</p> 
<p>What stands out from this is a positional consideration. It’s very true that being at the ready with a dust pan and brush stinks, but consider using different tools and a different context.</p> 
<p>If you’ve been positioned as a janitor, despite being hired for what you thought was a different role, act like you’re working in the position you were hired for. Stop taking on only a cleaning role, but more, stop letting others think that is your role. You can’t always quit your job and just start over somewhere else. It’s not that easy. Enact subtle changes now to re-position yourself into the role you were hired for originally.</p> 
<p>What if, instead of loathing the company owner described above, you chose to be a partner? Put yourself on his/her schedule for breakfast or lunch. Ask about his/her hopes for the company. Ask how he/she hopes to get that done. Ask how he/she sees the organization needing to change or bend to make that happen. Put down the broom and pick up a pen (or iPad). Have a couple of meals together to unpack these questions and the ones they’ll lead to. Take notes. You’ll see the small ways you can insert your expertise and ideas into the conversation. You can begin to change the view of your role in that leader’s eyes.</p> 
<p>Come back to mission and vision. Plan, in your second to fourth meal time, to bring up what you understand the mission to be. How does your manager see it? Are there connections to the expressed hopes for the organization? You’re now moving into an analytical posture with your leadership. That’s an attractive position because it opens the door wider for analysis of the organization.</p> 
<p>Look at the team around you, too. Where are strengths being used? Where are they lacking? And is the right person doing the right thing? You already know that your role has mutated unhealthily, so don’t be surprised that others are suffering in the same way. Put down the dust pan and pick up a conductor’s baton. Pull them out of it and put them in places to showcase the hirable skills originally displayed. And if there are tasks that need to be done, get them done, but be smart about assigning them. Look to see where those tasks make the most sense. Remember, you can then speak to your manager about this thoughtfulness and restructuring in the context of the conversations you’ve been having with him/her.</p> 
<p>That alignment is a display of giftedness meant for your role. Granted, clean-up is important, especially when you first get to a company. However, don’t stay in that posture. Just because you can clean up doesn’t mean you should always do it. And if there is that much going on, something is broken and you can fix it.</p> 
<p>A stumble along this new path may occur. You might find that the last week has put you back into clean-up mode only. It’s okay. You’re re-training yourself as well as others. A step back is not uncommon. Just make a course correction.</p> 
<p>You can start over right where you are. Make weeks into escapades rather than preparation to escape! You don’t need to go back to first grade to prove you have something valuable to offer. But, if you start seeing giant penguins running around the office, the pressure has definitely gotten to you. Time to use some PTO.</p>

<!--more--><p>While an assertive person channels and promotes good communication, the slide into aggression parlays that into interruption and talking over people. &nbsp;It's a subtle slide. &nbsp;There are characteristics that start healthy enough but then become twisted and contorted by a shifting foundation.</p> 
<p>Is there something more lurking just a little deeper? &nbsp;A lack of self-esteem may be at play. &nbsp;It's not to say you don't have any self-esteem, but rather it's development might be askew. &nbsp;Dr. Michael Miller, former editor in chief of the Harvard Mental Health Letter, says, “It’s more likely that self-esteem will come as a result of accurate self-understanding, appreciation of one’s genuine skills, and the satisfaction of helping others.” &nbsp;As managers, is this our stance?</p> 
<p>Observations for years show me how much management often find their identity in the work they do. &nbsp;This becomes the basis for self-worth and self-esteem. &nbsp;And this is a simple recipe for disaster. &nbsp;When we base our esteem upon shifting sand, such as a particular organization, the work being done or even the people we work with, the foundation is based upon change. &nbsp;People leave, we leave, the work changes and organizations are sold, merged, restructured or altered. &nbsp;If we live for the company, we will be disappointed.</p> 
<p>Our audience, however, might be receiving management poorly based upon the dilemma of assertive/aggressive or confidence/conceit. &nbsp;Again, if it's a matter of self-esteem, your staff can easily identify the difference. &nbsp;When a manager is over-the-top or a micro-manager, the talk among employees will start rather quickly. &nbsp;It sets a tone for response that's based upon someone's individual needs (in this case, the manager) rather than the good of the whole. &nbsp;Staff begin to look for ways to avoid the wrath of a manager or even seeing the manager at all. &nbsp;These goals supersede the goals of the department in the work to be done.</p> 
<p>Such a backwards setup. &nbsp;We short-circuit the efforts towards our department's goals by the way in which we struggle to handle ourselves and the workload, for instance. &nbsp;Help is an okay option. &nbsp;It's not a sign of weakness, despite the possibility that your employer may think so. &nbsp;And while I know your job is important to you (your finances, for example!), it cannot be that you should become less of the person you are or are meant to be. &nbsp;Simple to say, right? &nbsp;But what does it profit you to be aggressive, struggling with self-esteem or self-worth and not meet the goals you've set for work? &nbsp;Right the ship. &nbsp;Take the time necessary to unravel what's been going on.</p> 
<p>Typically, managing the esteem of a manager is not on a job description, yet we see it happen. &nbsp;Don't be the manager putting employees in this situation. &nbsp;Get grounded outside of the work. &nbsp;Then, when work needs to be done, it is a matter of how to best do it, apart from it fulfilling some esteem needs. &nbsp;And while I am far from a self-help guru, I do know enough that there is truth that a person must discover for himself/herself that is separate from work, from a person or from status. &nbsp;Take the time to examine yourself and find out what's true about you.</p> 
<p>In human resources, we can find ourselves giving so much to others, which is a part of our job, that we tax our own foundation. &nbsp;We must be sure to connect inwardly.</p> 
<p>Pushing the envelope is worth it. &nbsp;Don't fear being assertive. &nbsp;It does matter in driving the goals of your department. &nbsp;However, it is meant to be done with a specific goal in mind for the organization, not for your esteem. &nbsp;If work defines you, take a small step back and look at the bigger picture. &nbsp;Your role needs you to be as with it as possible. &nbsp;You are the one in the role for a reason. &nbsp;Get back to you.</p>

<!--more--><p>#WorkHuman was a conference recently held by&nbsp;<a class=""g-profile"" href=""https://plus.google.com/117626203492310368836"" target=""_blank"" data-gapiattached=""true"" data-onload=""true"" data-gapiscan=""true"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">+Globoforce</a>&nbsp;in Orlando. And while it was a conference founded upon recognition thoughts and strategies, there was a push towards happiness that I found refreshingly interesting.</p> 
<p>From a scientific approach, the concept of happiness was explored by Shawn Achor. &nbsp;What benefit is there to happiness in the workplace? &nbsp;Of course, we would rather people be happy than sad at work. &nbsp;It's not likely that any of us looks to see a line of sad people outside of our door that we need to convert to happy ones. &nbsp;However, there is something to be said about our ability to promote a happier culture. &nbsp;<a class=""g-profile"" href=""https://plus.google.com/117280911907790899762"" target=""_blank"" data-gapiattached=""true"" data-onload=""true"" data-gapiscan=""true"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">+JetBlue</a>&nbsp;VP of People Michael Elliott shared how it's the job of HR, for example, to sell the success stories of the company. &nbsp;Preach the ways we shine. &nbsp;We have an opportunity to support the core values and encourage the mission of our organizations through a pursuit of happiness.</p> 
<p>Consider, however, the concept of joy. &nbsp;Happiness tends to be an emotional consideration, and while there are fuller perspectives, joy is more of a state of being. &nbsp;What can we do to foster this level of consideration? &nbsp;How can pursuing the right perspective of such a state of being impact workplace culture?</p> 
<ul> 
 <li><b>Where does the joy come from?</b> - Look for ways to push those around us to consider self-awareness. &nbsp;Not necessarily in the metaphysical sense, but think of it in light of the wellness and mindfulness initiatives available to us. &nbsp;Grounding people is a gift. &nbsp;Very often, we get ensnared by the busyness of our roles. &nbsp;We need to motivate ourselves to do our work because it's an expression of who we are. &nbsp;Look to align the joy being cultivated in you around the functional roles of existence. &nbsp;If it's out of line, you'll sense it clearly. &nbsp;Adjust this in a timely manner and, then, recalibrate.</li> 
 <li><b>What can the joy do for others?</b> - In addition to the ways joy brings a stability to self, the joy one has can serve as a beacon to those looking to secure their own. &nbsp;Reflecting the active nature of joy will inspire others, but will be done as a genuine by-product. &nbsp;Manufacturing a trite or programmatic approach to this will be apparent to others observing, and the initiative will fail. &nbsp;The honesty that joy gives is infectious and truthful. &nbsp;There is something so attractive about someone who is naturally full of joy. &nbsp;If you have known someone like this, think about how he/she made you feel. &nbsp;Don't hide the joy at work; live it fully and others will observe it.</li> 
 <li><b>What will work be like in light of joy?</b> - A <a href=""http://fortune.com/2015/10/29/happy-productivity-work/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">study in Britain</a> showed that providing happiness outlets, even in small doses, could increase productivity by as much as 12%. &nbsp;12%?! &nbsp;Think about that. &nbsp;That could be tens of thousands to hundreds of millions for our companies. &nbsp;Amazing to think that encouraging happiness could lead to such results. &nbsp;And the feeling of happiness leads to an openness to joy, contentment and satisfaction. &nbsp;When workplaces cultivate this type of depth, talent does not look to leave as willingly, especially those who've worked in other environments. &nbsp;There will be a great appeal to remain connected and committed to who and what the company is.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>None of this is meant to cover up the difficulties that come along with living. &nbsp;Sickness, financial strain, divorce, death...all of this and more vie for our attention and steal our joy. &nbsp;We should not look to be smiling idiots or attempt to gloss over the pain that others might have. &nbsp;We're still people, People!</p> 
<p>The thoughts here are reflective of the measurable affect that happiness can bring to the workplace. &nbsp;While at this conference,&nbsp;<a class=""g-profile"" href=""https://plus.google.com/102162377433663280831"" target=""_blank"" data-gapiattached=""true"" data-onload=""true"" data-gapiscan=""true"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">+The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research</a>&nbsp;founder was on-hand to share his perspective on life. &nbsp;To hear someone who could have become rather bitter and jaded at the unfairness of life, share that he loves his life, is humbling. &nbsp;The gripes about work - the amount to do, the managers that annoy and the lack of variety of coffee flavors - find a better context and become minimized in light of such a perspective. &nbsp;Michael J. Fox shared his heart and his joy. &nbsp;The lesson for all of us is to do the same.</p>

<!--more--><p>Auntie Em, the perennial calling card for home, is face to face with Almira Gulch. &nbsp;Em has the perfect opportunity to tell Almira off. &nbsp;Ms. Gulch has come to take away Toto (not Toto!), and it's crushing to the young Dorothy. &nbsp;Em's maternal instinct kicks in and she's ready to take on this brash lizard of a woman. &nbsp;And what does she say? &nbsp;""Almira Gulch, just because you own half the county doesn't mean that you have the power to run the rest of us. For twenty-three years, I've been dying to tell you what I thought of you! And now... well, being a Christian woman, I can't say it!"" &nbsp;NO!</p> 
<p>Why didn't she say it? &nbsp;We're all there with her. &nbsp;We want Em to haul off and deck her, honestly, and instead she leads us up to the finish line and then falls down just prior. &nbsp;So frustrating. &nbsp;We tend to do the same in HR.</p> 
<div> 
 <p>Think about terminations. &nbsp;There are some that bring great joy to our hearts, admit it. &nbsp;We're thrilled to see this slug of a human being exit our organization. &nbsp;This person has been the bane of our existence for too long. &nbsp;We've spent hours on this person and the situations created as a result. &nbsp;And while there was hopefully some good that came through it all (management training, refinement of the discipline process), it is still a huge sigh of relief that he/she is gone.</p> 
 <p>Far be it from me to get my Philly on and ask you to just tell the person off on his/her way out (If you need that help, though, my mom is available for a reasonable cost...she's fantastic at it). &nbsp;However, there is a truth to be shared. &nbsp;In terminations, for example, it is helpful to the person for us to share what he/she can take from the experience in prep for the next role. &nbsp;Frankly, we preach that formal reviews should contain nothing that hasn't already been shared with the employee. &nbsp;So, sitting with the person on the way out to remind him/her of the progression shouldn't be new news. &nbsp;What it is though is an honest recap of truth.</p> 
 <p>Haven't you hired someone and three months later think, ""How did this person ever hold a job?"" &nbsp;And yet, they've worked for ten years' previous. &nbsp;Likely, managers were just glad to see them go and didn't share much to help that person transition to the next role.</p> 
 <p>And don't wait for a termination. &nbsp;Give honest perspective throughout. &nbsp;Are you afraid of being sued? &nbsp;Seriously? &nbsp;Anyone can sue any company for any reason. &nbsp;Why fear what can happen no matter what? &nbsp;I've watched companies get served lawsuits that are baseless and untrue, and yet still have to settle. &nbsp;I don't think I am bitter in this, but rather, I take it as constructive freedom.</p> 
 <p>Please don't lose your basic HR communicative flow. &nbsp;Frame your words, be thoughtful and encourage dialogue. &nbsp;Ask perspective questions of the employee. &nbsp;Be knowledgeable of the situation and prepared to discuss. &nbsp;And tell the truth.</p> 
 <p>I would love to tell off a million people, give or take a thousand, but that's not ultimately for their benefit. &nbsp;However, don't swing the pendulum too far the other way. &nbsp;Don't live in fear and therefore not share enough. &nbsp;Give people constructive feedback in an honest framework. &nbsp;And if you need the release, go outside, behind the building and lose your mind. &nbsp;And then come in, visit security, watch the video footage and crack yourself up. &nbsp;You'll be back in the right frame of mind afterwards.</p>

<!--more--><p>Have you seen the little girl telling her dad a lie about <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qss9CndNkKk"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">what happened to Barbie</a> (and why?). &nbsp;You must! &nbsp;Amazing insight into our DNA. &nbsp;We're not taught how to lie; it's a natural phenomenon for us. &nbsp;We just do it in order to avoid trouble, deflect attention or save our skin. &nbsp;Truth is easily replaced by a lie. &nbsp;Consider the countless times people get pulled over. &nbsp;Think everyone tells the cop the truth? &nbsp;Or even playing the ""I was speeding? I had no idea. Oh my gosh,"" when you know full well that you were flooring it. &nbsp;Some of us give Oscar-worthy performances!</p> 
<p>Fear is a huge motivator of our words. &nbsp;What would it mean if an HR Manager said that he/she didn't know something that's HR related? &nbsp;It shouldn't be a shock, but fear might stand in the way of that HR Manager being honest. &nbsp;He/She might be afraid of looking weak or not-as-experienced as a supervisor would expect. &nbsp;And so, if we are backed into a corner with our fear, we might lie. &nbsp;We might say we know something. &nbsp;We might say we have done a certain task. &nbsp;We might offer perspective as if we've been there-done that. &nbsp;All of it is dishonest. &nbsp;And now those lies have to be built upon as time goes on. &nbsp;Those lies own you.</p> 
<p>Organizational health functions best in honesty. &nbsp;When staff know that the words of the leaders are real, the response is genuine. &nbsp;In late 2008, when the economy in the US fell due to the housing crisis, company leaders sat with their employees to let them know what was going on. &nbsp;In some of those conversations, layoffs were presented as a viable option to save money. &nbsp;The response from many employees was to keep everyone and just reduce every employee's hours. &nbsp;They understood what was happening, why it was happening, and based upon the honest dialogue from leadership, volunteered a plan of action. &nbsp;While the stress of the economics was real and cannot be denied, there was health in the approach to all get into the same boat and hold on.</p> 
<p>It is important to note that no one is alone in this. &nbsp;In some ways, we've helped create a culture of untruth. &nbsp;Our fantasies are affirmed more than our realities. &nbsp;We have allowed our leadership to be untrustworthy for a long while. &nbsp;Just looking at our political landscape reflects such a position. Our role as management, as leaders, is to break the cycle. &nbsp;I am not naive to think that this will mean open doors for everything with full disclosure. &nbsp;Quite frankly, there are details that are not for the world to know. &nbsp;This is not dishonest if it's shared just that way....""Here's what I can tell you and understand there are some parts that I cannot offer much detail due to (confidentiality, a matter of law, unsettled circumstances, etc.)""</p> 
<p>We have one another to stand with in our doubt, in our lack of knowledge and in our fear. It's okay to not know something. &nbsp;That's the beauty of asking our community, of attending seminars and workshops, of developing friendships with managers from other companies. &nbsp;We can't know it all, and we have to be okay to say so. &nbsp;Honestly, I know for myself and some others who've shared with superiors where our difficulties were, we were not fired.</p> 
<p>Perhaps, you find this whole topic puzzling or amateur. &nbsp;Fine, but the reality is that there is enough fear pushing a lack of truth in our workplaces. &nbsp;If it's not you, it may be someone working for you. &nbsp;Do our staff feel that they can say what they don't know without fear of reprisal? &nbsp;Are they apt to lie? &nbsp;How can we cultivate a different environment?</p> 
<p>In HR, we see people lie often. &nbsp;It's sad, but true. &nbsp;We read resumes containing experiences that never occurred. &nbsp;We hear from employees in a disciplinary situation covering their butts. &nbsp;We hear executives tell us that everyone will keep their jobs as a result of a merger. &nbsp;It is all around us. &nbsp;We can push for a more honest culture by being an example first.</p>","https://21594889.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21594889/Imported_Blog_Media/You-Dont-Own-Me.jpg","","PUBLISHED","false"

<!--more--><p>The specifics of the situation may change but the overall issue remains the same. &nbsp;On <u>Three's Company</u>, the plotline was the same - some misunderstanding (usually of a sexual or relational nature), followed by a poor response, an awkward reveal of the truth, and then, reconciliation. &nbsp;The core issue was mistrust, but the situations that revealed it changed.</p> 
<p>In our organizations, we might find ourselves facing the same circumstances. &nbsp;There is a core issue at hand that seems to reveal itself in what appear to be unconnected situations. &nbsp;In actuality, they are absolutely connected. &nbsp;I recently was with some HR pros who were addressing an issue that had come up a few times previously. &nbsp;The situation was presented newly, but the core issue remained the same. &nbsp;And what we do in HR often does not push the envelope towards addressing the core issue. &nbsp;HR tends to seek peace as its goal. &nbsp;We'll just hurry up and find a quick solution to the situation, rather than the issue, and hope that it doesn't come up again or that the person who continues to pick at the issue leaves the organization. &nbsp;This is not managing the situation effectively.</p> 
<p>What we can do is take the posture of dialogue to reveal the core issue. &nbsp;Allow the conversation to move beyond the buzz of cliched approaches with which we get caught up - we need to manage this change better, we need to assess our strengths so we know if we've got the right people on the bus, we need to have an outing so that we can unify our team. &nbsp;Listen, those things can be great, but if the core issue is lack of trust, then none of those recommendations, along with a thousand others like it, won't work. &nbsp;It will serve as confirmation, in some cases, as to why the mistrust is there. &nbsp;Cliques, suspicion and faux-enthusiasm become obstacles heaped upon an already tough set of circumstances.</p> 
<p>Consider sitting in a room and simply asking, ""Who wants to be here?"" &nbsp;What if we start with that? &nbsp;What if we push the conversation around why people don't want to be there? &nbsp;In some cases, there's so much damage in the history book that someone might not be motivated to meet in the middle. &nbsp;If that's the case, then an organization can just keep pouring good resources towards resolution that will never come. &nbsp;If someone wants out, then sometimes that's the best answer. &nbsp;There is not going to be a pretty bow around it and that person may not speak well of you or the organization upon departure. &nbsp;Honestly, oh, well.</p> 
<p>Learn the lesson from that situation and understand that the core issue still needs to be addressed with those remaining. &nbsp;Call it out. &nbsp;Put it on the table. &nbsp;Have an honest dialogue about it and understand that all parties might not see the same circumstance through the same lens. &nbsp;Embrace it, as frustrating as it might be, and ask good questions as to how to handle the core issue. &nbsp;It's not about dying on the hill of circumstances, but rather fighting to get back to giving others the benefit of the doubt. &nbsp;As a team, we have to encourage that, but we have to do it from the core, not the surface.</p> 
<p>Some of us need to wake up and take stock of the issues in our organizations. &nbsp;Stop pretending they aren't there, that they'll go away or that it's someone else's problem. &nbsp;Our job is to address and provide the forum for dialogue, healing and growth moving forward. &nbsp;We lay out expectations on both sides for moving this forward. &nbsp;We don't accept everyone's stubbornness; we don't bow to fear. &nbsp;We don't allow one thing to be said in our meetings and then another to be said at the cubicles. &nbsp;We push for honesty, grace and truth.</p> 
<p>Listen, I recognize how hard this can be in some of our companies. &nbsp;I know that there is entrenched organizational un-health and the unwilling spirits of employees. &nbsp;But, I also know that there will only be repeat episodes of <u>Three's Company</u> as long as nothing is done to get to the core issue. &nbsp;And those episodes will play without a laugh track.</p>

<!--more--><p>For those of you re-watching episodes on MeTV of ""Happy Days"" (or maybe watching them for the first time), you know that the coolest guy on the earth in the 1970's was Arthur Fonzarelli, aka Fonzie. &nbsp;Initially labeled a juvenile delinquent, Fonzie rose to show a deeper character and a true coolness. &nbsp;When an organization that worked with kids with who suffered serious abuse and were emotional stifled came to the attention of director Garry Marshall, he wanted Fonzie to alter the label of super-cool a bit. &nbsp;When Fonzie cried in one episode, and those kids watched it, the result was an open door for that agency to help those kids. &nbsp;They were ready to emote since Fonzie did.</p> 
<p>The labeling takes over rather quickly, however. &nbsp;We decide who is a jerk, who is nice, who is conceited, who is fake, who is a wimp. &nbsp;We connect people into categories and then treat the group in that category in the same manner. &nbsp;We respond singularly, for example, to someone who is mean. &nbsp;For some of us, we retreat from such a person. &nbsp;For others, we look to engage and rip apart that person. &nbsp;It's a sport - the art of the run and the art of the fight. &nbsp;We all travel the scale and, for some of us, we have to manage people on the same scale.</p> 
<p>Our involvement in the label movement is an everyday contribution. &nbsp;When we treat our employees in a responsive manner rather than at the level we want them to operate, we display our commitment to the label rather than the person. &nbsp;To be sure, there are jerks. &nbsp;Of course, those jerks might not be long for their employment. &nbsp;Yet, even if they are &nbsp;to be with you for a short time, let's engage them in a way that calls them to greatness rather than meets them in their jerkiness.</p> 
<p>As you think about how you're reacting, consider these thoughts:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li><b>Check your tone</b> - are you sharper with a particular person than others? &nbsp;Is your label of that person the reason for the difficulty in communication?</li> 
 <li><b>Re-read emails before you send them</b> - when tone is hard to know, as it is in emails, it means that a bit more time should be spent re-reading prior to send. &nbsp;You may be giving shade, even unintentionally, by doors you've left open for interpretation of words (and, yes, I said ""shade"").</li> 
 <li><b>Examine distribution of work</b> &nbsp;- are you sharing types of work as well as the amount of work equally, based upon skill sets alone? &nbsp;Or are you giving the crappy work only to the employee you've labeled negatively?</li> 
 <li><b>Rotate opportunities to lead</b> - Allow staff to take turns leading various meetings, training sessions or projects. &nbsp;By rotating the team leader, you are sure that you're negative slant towards someone isn't getting in the way of job expectations and opportunities.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>If you're thinking, ""I would never let So-And-So lead a meeting or be in charge of a specific type of work"", that's fine. &nbsp;I would just ask back, ""Well, then, why is he/she still working at the company?"" &nbsp;If the basis work of work isn't being met that you've uniformly given, then the employment of that person should end. &nbsp;The work is the reason a person is hired.</p> 
<p>Bear in mind, too, that people might just sometimes surprise you. &nbsp;The jerk could let his/her guard down and show you how wonderful he/she is. &nbsp;The wimp might find his/her courage due to the way you're running the department. &nbsp;The fake might become the most authentic person on your team as he/she learns that skill sets and work product matter more than the facade portrayed. &nbsp;If Fonzie can cry, then any of these changes could happen. Heyyyyy...</p>

It is the art of providing or delivering attention to someone for a particular accomplishment. It could be about the achievement of a specific goal or to mark a milestone within the organization. It is valuable and provides proof that the company sees what its employees are doing and, sometimes, for the way in which those actions benefit the organization.</p> 
<!--more--><p>Of course, if someone works on a project for six months and it turns out great, it's very nice to be recognized for having finished the work well. There is a benefit to those who see how the achievement of their work matters. Connectivity is very important and it allows the performer to see how action produces real results, per person, piece by piece. All of the cogs on the wheel are fantastically connected. It's a great picture and the recognition factor drives it home.<br> Is that it?</p> 
<p>Long are the conversations regarding felt needs and reward. Do we merely offer a plaque, a gift card, a weekend away and check off the box of recognition? When dealing with real people with real baggage and real emotion living real lives, providing inauthentic trinkets may not pack the punch hoped for by the organization. And what can often happen is that companies become bitter towards recognition because they sense an ungrateful response by employees. What was meant to be a motivator becomes an open sore of tension pushing division.</p> 
<p>As practical as we ought to be in HR (don't get me started on the value of business acumen and metrics, people!), we cannot swing the pendulum so far that we forget the people we are trying to serve. Consider the concept of restorative recognition. This is the kind of recognition that knows where people are, what makes them tick, what their circumstances are and then rewards them in the context of a real situation. The deficiencies in their lives may not all be met, but we're providing appropriate levels of engaged recognition that we know will touch upon it.</p> 
<p>The Make a Wish Foundation is magical because for years it has provided terminally ill children with the opportunity to have their greatest wish granted. From going to a prom to meeting the President to being Batman for a day, the stories have touched the hearts of those precious children, of their parents and families and of the millions who watch the stories unfold. It affects the heart.</p> 
<p>An employee who is struggling to pay for a child's college education is a real need. We can know that. Handing that employee a gift card for Macy's as a reward for an achieved goal or milestone is not going to solve the need of paying for college. Nor is the point to give them $5000 as the reward in order to meet that need. Think. Be creative. What would it mean to that employee to be recognized for the work he/she did that met the criteria for reward by handing him/her proof of monies being deposited into his/her child's college campus account for textbook purchases or towards the meal plan? It's thoughtful. It's given in light of knowing your employees. It's an absolute way of endearing employees to the organization even more.</p> 
<p>Think I'm crazy? Get in line. The point is that we can know these things about our staff and make a choice to recognize in restorative ways. People carry around burdens and dreams. Practically, we can't grant wishes all day, nor do we have the budget to do so. Yet, we can use our imaginations and creativity to do something more than rummaging through a drawer in our office to find an Amazon gift card for a giveaway.</p> 
<p>How many of your staff didn't get to go on a honeymoon? How many haven't been able to take their spouse out due to a lack of affordable child care? How many dreamed to be a professional baseball player? How many trained as a dancer all throughout their childhood and have no opportunity to fit it into life now? Now, be creative. Work with a vendor partner to secure a weekend or an overnight to a bed and breakfast. Work with a local certified and approved child care service provider for one night of child care (and throw an Uber and dinner in). Get tickets to a baseball game and work with the event staff to throw some confetti on the employee to celebrate the Home Run Hitter he/she is at work. Provide a six-week dance class to the employee that can happen after work in an open space right in the building.</p> 
<p>These aren't all of the solutions. They may be none in your particular case, but the point is that restorative recognition goes a long way to show that our involvement is thoughtful and done as a result of knowing our people. As said earlier, connectivity is very important and it allows the performer to see how action produces real results, per person, piece by piece. By doing this in a tailored manner, we cut to the soul of our people as well as of ourselves. As a blubberer myself, I can tell you that when we're this thoughtful, people are moved and the tears flow.</p> 
<p>Get those creative juices flowing and know that people need more than a crystal pyramid with their name engraved. That isn't likely to hit them deeply, but tickets to a concert of the one performer they've never had the chance to see before will. Because you took the time to know them. Because the company is invested in its employees. Because we're building community.</p>

<!--more--><p>When <u>The First Wives' Club</u> started, the divorcees had all experienced a cheating spouse. &nbsp;A spouse who found ""happiness"" in the arms of another (younger) woman. &nbsp;The spark of attraction that originally came from the first wife was replaced with bland familiarity, boredom and predictability. &nbsp;Of course what follows is hilarity, a song and dance number and domestic earnings of over $100 million (and counting). &nbsp;In the movies, this is an ""of course""; in our real lives, the song and dance is not usually found.</p> 
<p>The struggle to find connection pulls at the heart of any relationship, whether person to person or person to purpose. &nbsp;Brokenness and disconnect make other options seem more appealing. &nbsp;There is a longing for something so much more than what someone is living. &nbsp;And knowing this is a tendency for many of us, what do we do about it? &nbsp;If we serve in a position of influence, however small, what kind of difference can we make?</p> 
<p>A job becomes stale and predictable, just as a relationship does, when there is no encouragement towards or opportunity for creativity. &nbsp;The imaginative spark has been studied for decades, particularly in its symbiotic nature with organizational change. &nbsp;Creativity pushes boundaries and considers what might be. &nbsp;Think about how your organization would benefit from such a posture. &nbsp;Wouldn't the organization change as a result? &nbsp;Perhaps it's the development of a new product or process. &nbsp;Perhaps the method of delivery is improved or completely made over. &nbsp;In some measurable way, the creative outlets for staff will drive organizational change.</p> 
<p>Think about the correlation to relationships. &nbsp;Wouldn't approaching a date with enthusiastic creativity likely make the date memorable? &nbsp;If it's just dinner, again, where is the imagination? &nbsp;So many of my friends do ""date night"" once a month with their spouses. &nbsp;It's often just dinner. &nbsp;Yawn. &nbsp;It's no wonder that the time that's meant for connection becomes time spent looking at your iPhone to see what time it is. &nbsp;Oh, when do we have to leave to get the kids?</p> 
<p>Stagnant relationships at work function in the same manner. &nbsp;How do your staff relate to what their doing? &nbsp;Do they own it? &nbsp;Do they have an opportunity to enlarge their roles? &nbsp;Bring your team together to see how this can happen. &nbsp;Collaboration, also, fights against the restlessness of the role. &nbsp;Working together and corporately setting goals for engagement and impact take the wandering eye off of what might be and focus it on what is and will be. &nbsp;High functioning teams are not buzzworthy for the latest SHRM Conference; they have merit because the stats back it up. &nbsp;Sales training, like Sandler, spend a full day on these merits and outcomes. &nbsp;Jacob Morgan wrote a killer article on collaboration in <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacobmorgan/2013/07/30/the-12-habits-of-highly-collaborative-organizations/#6c09b4575f12"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Forbes</a> a few years ago where he points out the heightened functionality that collaboration gives to the individual contributor, even when there are team or corporate benefits as well.</p> 
<p>An individual who is creative and collaborative has too much going on to wander. &nbsp;He/She sees a place for contribution, impact and recognition. &nbsp;The temptress walking by (whether a job posting, a call surveying interest to jump ship, etc.) isn't as appealing. &nbsp;A deep connection to the work being done at the organization will keep people there. &nbsp;The retention rate moves up, knowledge management can actually happen and succession planning becomes succession actuality. &nbsp;The hunger for more is met with real opportunity from and with the same company.</p> 
<p>As people who get to encourage our teams, it's important that we remember our relationships need vibrancy. &nbsp;Our connection to the work, to the mission, to purpose have to be encouraged and kept fresh. &nbsp;The lax that leads to a wandering heart will cost our companies money and time and resources. &nbsp;Our staff will not be firing on all cylinders. &nbsp;Stir the fire of creativity and spark collaboration. &nbsp;And you'll satisfy the hunger.</p>

<!--more--><p>From a humanistic standpoint, there is satisfaction in watching a poor performer lose.&nbsp; It’s why movies like “Working Girl” or “9 to 5” are shown on TCM.&nbsp; The plot lines are classic and stir up in us a desire to see someone pay for taking credit for the work of others.&nbsp; We want to see that perpetrator fired.&nbsp; We want to see the hard-working underdog get his/her retribution and overdue recognition.&nbsp; Our nature inclines toward a measure of justice, fairness and goodness.</p> 
<p>And yet, when a termination has to happen, even if for those reasons, do we in human resources lose our composure and impartiality?&nbsp; Think about why Roz, the HR Manager, in ""9 to 5"" is believable. &nbsp;And though we’re not judges, we do represent the larger picture for the organizational culture we seek to encourage.&nbsp; If we’re cruel with someone’s feelings or circumstances, then others who work in the organization might view our approach as exemplary of how things are done at the company.&nbsp; What was just about a termination might now open the door for sub-par treatment in other employment relationships.</p> 
<p>Consider:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Gossip – How many people really need to know about the termination?&nbsp; The temptation to share with at least one other person is real.&nbsp; And while that may not tempt you, it may be that the HR team has taken to inter-departmental gossip about a particular person’s departure.&nbsp; We call that “safe” since it’s among the HR staff.&nbsp; Is it?&nbsp; What is our example to our junior staff members?&nbsp; If we complain that HR is not included in some other components of the organization’s function and development, perhaps it’s due to the known loose lips of the HR department, even amongst each other.&nbsp; Gossip is only about making you feel better about yourself, pure and simple.&nbsp; Listen to what you’re saying about others as you share.&nbsp; Would you just die if those personal notes were being shared about you to others?</li> 
 <li>Just Cause – Of course, documentation is a necessary component of any good termination process as it really starts as part of the overall discipline process, but are you building a case out of a real problematic situation or more because you don’t like the person?&nbsp; I have watched good employees be terminated because someone did not like a personality, a habit, a laugh (I’m not kidding), etc.&nbsp; Would it be any surprise that people would be afraid to be around an HR department like this?&nbsp; Who could be secure? &nbsp;Look at why and how these terminations are occurring. &nbsp;Validity and consistency of approach are pillars for the HR team.</li> 
 <li>Management Training – Every termination is an opportunity to grow management.&nbsp; Allow each situation to be a case study for discussion, explanation and potential change with management.&nbsp; Is there something that should have been or could be done better? &nbsp;Look together at how this termination might spur others on towards excellence.&nbsp; How do we foster that?&nbsp; Develop a plan of growth with management for those employees whose cages will be rattled.&nbsp; Train a manager through this.&nbsp; Or just settle for the basic thrill of dropping the hammer on someone’s employment.&nbsp; It’s too easy to merely laugh with management and then be done.&nbsp; Use every opportunity to grow people.</li> 
 <li>HR Support – Why did this employee fail?&nbsp; While, in certain circumstances, it will be hard to find anything more that the organization could have done to support the success of the employee, it won’t be the case all of the time.&nbsp; What broke?&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; If it means job duty changes, do it.&nbsp; If it’s about qualifications rather than the duties, then update them.&nbsp; If a manager is struggling to deal with someone different than him/her, then coach them.&nbsp; Whatever action has to happen, work out a plan to do it.&nbsp; Too many HR departments will sit back after a termination and throttle the manager or other employees in the department.&nbsp; We know best, right?&nbsp; As we sit in our unapproachable offices sitting on our ergonomic throne, we dictate our truths about our people and our company.&nbsp; Probably not the best approach.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>This employee being fired is a person. &nbsp;And as simple as this last thought may be, it is classically the one forgotten the most. &nbsp;He/She has to go home and tell loved ones.&nbsp; He/She has to deal with what's next.&nbsp; And while it may be completely the fault of this person as to why the separation is occurring, and we had to act to separate, this person should be treated respectfully in the process.&nbsp; It may not make for a great movie to end this way, but it makes for a great company when even the separation displays the right kind of response and culture.</p>

<!--more--><p>And when I walk through the halls of companies, I see employees devoid of emotion going through the task-management of the holiday season with no connection to one another or to the joy of the season.&nbsp; I see managers with scowls, associates with the faintest hint of a fake smile and HR people stressed out of their minds due to W2’s, ACA 1095’s, compliance reporting, labor law updates, minimum wage changes and the list goes on.</p> 
<p>Know what I say?&nbsp; Enjoy the time.&nbsp; Embrace the thrill of the season.&nbsp; Go to a department store or mall and watch the little kids excitedly get on Santa’s lap.&nbsp; Find those who have not yet been jaded by life and have learned to hate this time.&nbsp; Change the vantage point you’re working from.</p> 
<p>True followers of behavioral modification will tell you that change happens now.&nbsp; Just make the change, that’s the easy part.&nbsp; Stop with the frown and get on with the smile.&nbsp; And yet, the trick in behavioral modification is sustainability.&nbsp; What can be done to keep behavior changed?&nbsp; How does the decision I’ve made today last longer than just today?<br> For all people, it comes down to the same decision being made every day.&nbsp; Today may be the first day, but there are more days to consider and decide on.&nbsp; I know for me that today has enough troubles of its own, so I don’t need to travel too far down the road of what might be in days to come.&nbsp; Focus on today first.&nbsp; What am I doing and why?</p> 
<p>For those with real pain that seems to pierce the veil during the holiday season, I hear you.&nbsp; Take courage because there are many in the same boat.&nbsp; Find each other and decide to be a reason for joy for him/her.&nbsp; Look for ways to serve others and watch how much the burden lifts from you.&nbsp; It’s not idealistic; it’s psychological.</p> 
<p>My friend&nbsp;<a href=""https://plus.google.com/109204587154963604740"" data-gapiattached=""true"" data-onload=""true"" data-gapiscan=""true"">+Steve Browne</a>&nbsp;often speaks of being positive in HR.&nbsp; One of the best ways to do it is to foster deliberate and simple steps to think differently.&nbsp; We don’t have to have our Master’s degrees or 300 letters after our names to be able to affect change in thought and dynamic.&nbsp; We have to inspire others to make healthy decisions for themselves and, in turn, for the organization.&nbsp; Our culture is impacted greatly by such an attitude in staff.</p> 
<p>When I watch “Elf” each season, I am always struck by the forced conformity placed upon Buddy by his father and the world around him.&nbsp; His overly enthusiastic self is asked to be buttoned down into a suit and tie.&nbsp; He rebels, puts back on the elf suit and reconnects with Santa.&nbsp; The rebellion is based upon a decision.&nbsp; He decides to return to the positivity of what he knows.&nbsp; We, too, have the choice to return to the positivity of what we know.&nbsp; You're always going to have a new law to adhere to; we always do so don't stress.&nbsp; Get the elf suit on and enjoy this time of year!</p>

A bit of counseling, a dash of conflict management, a hint of patience and a strong dose of listening skills blend together to ensure that the staff you serve know they are heard and valued. The management of people is not a natural ebb and flow for most; it’s a dance mastered through practice, research and observation. Curious, I don’t see much of it taught on the university level. Management courses on business development, organizational development and finance (and their off-shoots) fill the curriculum for collegiate study.</p> 
<!--more--><p>I recall taking an interpersonal skills course in college, and there were seven of us on day one. By day two one had dropped as the size of the class was already too uncomfortable for him. So, the six of us plowed through various psychology and communicative styles in order to appreciate other approaches and develop our own more deeply. It was thoroughly challenging and incredibly vulnerable.</p> 
<p>So much of what was emphasized was basic response-oriented training. When someone walks into a room, acknowledge that person - say hello, ask them to have a seat, ask if you can help them. Body language, verbal cues and facial expression are a functional part of managing people. Further, and more likely for many these days, the tonality and inflection of the voice on the phone, and the sentence construct on a text or email, set the stage for an appropriate conversation with an employee.</p> 
<p>As our work in the human resources field continues to move in a metric-oriented discipline, which has great merit, it is vital that we not lose our people management skill set. And if you’ve never had a people management skill set, then it is time to work on it.</p> 
<p>When people come to you, there has already been a story playing for them. Pain or anger may have taken root, depending on the situation. Broken relationships cut deep – whether breakups, divorces or death. Our job is to get to the heart of it. We’re not counselors, understood, but if an employee is walking into your office, then bet your bottom dollar that whatever the issue is will distract that person from work. It is now a work consideration.</p> 
<p>Basic coping mechanisms may be extended to the person, and sometimes that happens naturally just by having someone on whom to unload. The skill sets of the employee could be clouded, but our act of listening and providing visual cues of such attention might move those clouds. The ability to jump back into the swing of “normal” functioning may be as simple as that. Yet, when the door is consistently closed and the email goes unanswered, an employee dives deeper into his/her issue, making it more difficult to un-cloud.</p> 
<p>Everyone has a story. There is no one free from baggage. Everyone wants more time. Everyone has regrets (or would like a do-over on some things). Everyone has lost their way for a bit. Remember this as a people manager. Those we manage do look to us. What do they see? Of course, depending on the situation, there are likely to be more steps after listening, but the first step sets the right tone.</p> 
<p>Answer the phone, respond to the email, open your door. Engage with your people. It doesn’t need to be seen as an employee engagement objective. It should be seen as being a person. A person who can support another person. And sometimes we’ll have quite a heavy burden to share in with this employee. We can manage the road together.</p>

<!--more--><p>For the employee who comes to the HR department with a complaint, inquiry or charge, there is an expectation for answers and investigation.&nbsp; HR loves the answers, but perhaps to a fault.&nbsp; Our ability to provide solution to the complaint may not really handle the issue at hand.&nbsp; The employee can feel his/her issue has been minimized as he/she leaves your office (or cubicle area or working table or Segway mobile office).&nbsp; Are we satisfied with just an “answer” or do we need to spend time trying to understand where this issue comes from?</p> 
<p>Honestly, there are times that a simple answer is all that is needed.&nbsp; Let’s not make a mountain out of molehill.&nbsp; If someone comes to complain about not being off for Arbor Day, that may be a very quick conversation.&nbsp; Something like, “I’m sorry that you’d like the company to be closed for Arbor Day, but if you have PTO available to you, perhaps you could plan on using some in order to spend time planting trees to honor the day.”&nbsp; Smile sincerely and usher them out.&nbsp; Close the door and reflect on why you’ve chosen the career you have.&nbsp; After a few minutes, you’ll be back at it!</p> 
<p>But what about the ones that take a bit more?&nbsp; If an employee asks about hours not paid on a paycheck, then perhaps a quick look at the time system, finding where the data was corrupt or not transferred into payroll will prevent the occurrence in the future.&nbsp; Perhaps there is a bit of management training needed.&nbsp; Perhaps the employee needs a reminder on the time clock.&nbsp; Perhaps it’s a one-time Gremlin in the system.&nbsp; All it would take is a little bit of research mixed with a little bit of conversation and/or training.</p> 
<p>And then, there are the ultimate investigations, such as harassment, discrimination or theft.&nbsp; A process for this investigation should be in place.&nbsp; What will it take for the company to handle the claims presented?&nbsp; Is there a path to follow?&nbsp; No?</p> 
<p>There are components of good investigation that are universal.&nbsp; Try to work within a flow of process in those components in order to gather the information needed.&nbsp; An investigation is serious and it does require professionalism in approach.&nbsp; If you are the HR person who would lead or conduct the investigation, have you established yourself in the company as someone capable of such work?&nbsp; If you’ve been relegated or allowed yourself to be relegated to the party-planning HR person or the gossip-laden HR person, then it’s not likely that you’ll gather all of the data necessary in your investigation.</p> 
<p>Staff may not be able to draw a line between the “Buddy HR” person and the “Detective HR” person you’re trying to be.&nbsp; That is a tall order.&nbsp; As such, determine whether outside help might be needed.&nbsp; Does your process allow for this possibility?&nbsp; Between the HR role played, the characters in the investigation and the subject matter involved, an outside expert might be the most beneficial for the organization.&nbsp; Be okay with letting someone in.&nbsp; It’s not about dirty laundry but about ascertaining the truth and finding solution, however difficult that may be.</p> 
<p>Be clear, too, in the fact that you will need to speak with others.&nbsp; When an employee starts his/her complaint to you with “Please don’t say anything, but…”, you can be sure that you’re likely going to need to say something to someone else.&nbsp; A true investigation will need facts and accounts from all parties named and involved.&nbsp; Keeping this between us is not possible, let alone the matter of law that may be in play.&nbsp; Disclosure may be required.&nbsp; Consult your counsel if you have questions in any of these areas.&nbsp; Likely an attorney will tell you that you cannot promise to keep what’s shared only between you two.</p> 
<p>There are great resources available to you to help with investigation.&nbsp; Take the time to research and develop a plan prior to needing a plan.&nbsp; You will be able to approach plan development with less stress and with more clarity of thought.&nbsp; Talk to your senior team, your counsel, your HR colleagues in other companies, your SHRM group…anyone who has been through developing a process. &nbsp;Learn from their victories and hiccups.</p> 
<p>And while it may not be the wisest to wear a badge around the office as if you’re the cop on duty, you should establish yourself as being an integral part of the investigative process at your company.&nbsp; Just pin the badge on the inside of your suit coat or sweater.&nbsp; You can know it’s there.&nbsp; Bum-Bump.</p>

Yes, there are attributes that come easier for some which allow them to manage easier, but the use and refinement of those attributes is what makes it right.&nbsp; The guilt some feel about not being a good manager is often a result of comparison to one of these “naturals.”</p> 
<!--more--><p>Are you a natural?&nbsp; Do you find yourself easily speaking with your team?&nbsp; Do you find that there is an ability to connect with people that just flows from you?&nbsp; That’s wonderful! But, it doesn’t mean that you’re managing people.&nbsp; It could mean that you are a great friend, a great listener, or a great motivator, but it doesn’t mean management is natural. &nbsp;Being the boss is meant to be categorized by effectiveness, best use of talent and profitability, to start, not merely being the ""fun"" manager.</p> 
<p>Think about a boss you’ve had that you liked. Perhaps the reason you liked him/her is because of the great manner with which your department was led.&nbsp; You liked that he/she took the reigns, presented as a resource for the team and kept everyone focused on the mission.&nbsp; You like that.&nbsp; You crave good direction.&nbsp; You desire knowledgeable people to take seriously their role.&nbsp; Perhaps.</p> 
<p>Or perhaps it was because you connected with him/her relationally.&nbsp; You had common interests.&nbsp; You shared a passion for sports, for a hobby or for beer (maybe beer is a hobby?).&nbsp; You got to know each other’s families.&nbsp; You shared time outside of work being social.&nbsp; Did that make the person a great manager?&nbsp; Or merely a great friend?</p> 
<p>I am not suggesting that every manager become a Miranda Priestly and remain clearly unfriendly and distant.&nbsp; However, I am suggesting that swinging the pendulum too far the other way might make managing just as a difficult.&nbsp; Hone in the skill sets needed to manage effectively and use those skills as you rally your team together.</p> 
<p><strong>Time</strong> – There is a skill involved in planning and in the usage of time.&nbsp; If you are someone that just lets things “get away from you” then you aren’t managing.&nbsp; Time needs to be managed.&nbsp; Haven’t we all looked at the clock during the work day and thought, “How can it be 3PM? I haven’t gotten done what I needed to today.”&nbsp; Be competent in time management and help your team to pursue a similar goal.&nbsp; Efficiencies to process are certainly business-centric and are worth the effort.</p> 
<p><strong>Material Knowledge</strong> – What do we make, how do we make it, why do we make it.&nbsp; If it’s a service-related industry, follow the same pattern – what do we do, how do we do it, why do we do it.&nbsp; You’ve got to know this backward and forward, and be able to translate it well to your team.&nbsp; They will look to you to see how seriously they should know the answers to those questions.&nbsp; If it’s just a job for you, then don’t be surprised when it’s just the same for your team.&nbsp; Be passionate about the ingredients, materials, resources used to get done what you are tasked to get done.</p> 
<p><strong>Communication</strong> – “Hey, Bud, how ya doin’ today?” should not serve as the moniker of your relational investment.&nbsp; What does that communicate?&nbsp; Likely, you are a necessary person in my life and I can’t avoid it.&nbsp; Intentionality in communication is necessary.&nbsp; Plan what needs to be said; don’t hope you remember.&nbsp; Know what and why things have to be shared, the time it will take to do so and the opportunities for that communication to be collaborative.</p> 
<p>Of course, there are more elements than this, but deciding to become proficient in these areas will certainly impact the team being managed.&nbsp; Once there is a mastery in skill development and process, then begin to attack the next step.&nbsp; It will become second nature.</p> 
<p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-20152"" style=""float: left; padding: 0px 20px 20px 0px"" src=""https://21594889.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21594889/Imported_Blog_Media/TheBoss2-1.jpg"" alt=""theboss2"" width=""320"" height=""212"">The effort matters.&nbsp; A manager who is deliberate in seeking to refine those skills or to develop new ones sets a stronger tone in his/her department right away.&nbsp; Your staff will recognize that you’re not there to be everyone’s best friend, but to be a developer of talent by taking seriously your own development.&nbsp; It also communicates a belief that not everyone is a “natural.”&nbsp; It’s okay to work at it. &nbsp;Think about the impact on the team you lead if they see you studying, practicing and exercising these skills.&nbsp; You will be encouraging them to do the same in their areas of functional responsibility and soft skill development.</p> 
<p>There were many days were I would have liked to do a “Devil-Wears-Prada-Throw-My Jacket-On-The-Head-Of-An-Employee” moment, but I didn’t.&nbsp; I had to make the decision that the proactive development of my management style would be compromised by either creating a too-friendly demeanor or a too-mean demeanor.&nbsp; So, hold onto your jacket as you walk in and hang it up yourself!</p>

<!--more--><p>Those are various performance phrases used in the dance world to encourage excellence in the performer.&nbsp; Uncomfortable?&nbsp; Did it make you think I’d finally snapped?&nbsp; (Don’t answer that).&nbsp; A dancer needs to have his/her performance graded early on so that he/she can make corrections to the movement in the dance.&nbsp; If a choreographer has developed a sequence of movement to tell a story and thoughtfully chosen a piece of music to compliment the story, it’s vital that the dancer perform the movement exactly to match the intention of the story.&nbsp; Real time performance review is necessary.</p> 
<p>In the case of the dancer, the choreographer is there teaching the dance.&nbsp; He/She can then provide timely feedback, such as listed above, and encourage the dancer to move differently or with more precision when working to execute the story through dance.&nbsp; Travis Wall, one of the best current choreographers, has to be unyielding in seeing his vision executed and so has to watch his dancers often and provide commentary.&nbsp; A dancer then adjusts in real time.&nbsp; And when the performance is shared with an audience, the efforts are displayed, and in Travis’s case, usually without flaw.</p> 
<p>Intentionally taking the time to watch the scenes of performance that our employees create is a responsibility of management.&nbsp; It is not to sit in an office and hope they are doing what they should be.&nbsp; It’s not just looking at numbers at the end of a day or week, and then make grandiose decisions about staffing and product or service implementation.&nbsp; The repetition of bad choices made in this context overflows into poor corporate culture, low gross sales, inferior candidates and frustrated management.</p> 
<p>Watch what’s happening in the “dance” scenes you’re creating at work.&nbsp; Give feedback.&nbsp; It does not need to be done via the official performance review annual form.&nbsp; It doesn’t have to be a quarterly review.&nbsp; It CAN include those things, but that’s not all it is.</p> 
<p>As a kid, when I was doing my homework, my mom would look over my shoulder every so often to check.&nbsp; If the writing was rushed and sloppy, she would tell me to erase it and write it again.&nbsp; The longer she took to check in on me left open the possibility that I would have more to erase.&nbsp; If she caught me after only doing a few, it was more manageable to correct the behavior and the remaining work was done neater.&nbsp; It’s the same for management.&nbsp; Observe often.</p> 
<p>Micromanagement, by the way, is not the same as observing often.&nbsp; A course correction is the responsibility of the manager by knowing why and how staff are travelling a certain road.&nbsp; A micromanager is telling staff how to move their left foot forward, and then the right foot, and then the left again, and then the right and so on.&nbsp; Travis can dance the choreography he creates himself, but the point is to take that vision and entrust it to the skill sets demonstrated in the dancers he works with regularly.&nbsp; The cause is spread to a wider circle and therefore a wider impact.</p> 
<p>Give staff the opportunity to perform.&nbsp; Tell them the objectives and watch what they do.&nbsp; &nbsp;And along the way, affirm what’s working and advise on what should look or be different.&nbsp; Keep coming back to the mission or purpose of the work.&nbsp; Managers have to be involved in what their teams are doing, with consistency and investment.&nbsp; Come up alongside those employees who are working to make the mission happen and encourage them.&nbsp; Praise and critique are encouraging, if it comes from an involved, invested perspective.&nbsp; Do your staff see you that way?</p> 
<p>The surprise in good performance review is that it seems very much like conversation.&nbsp; It feels very much like smart people sitting together to get better at the responsibilities they have.&nbsp; It opens the door for a deeper understanding of the support, tools and practice needed.&nbsp; And it also allows for honest dialogue, due to the consistency of review, regarding who can do what’s needed.&nbsp; Sometimes staff will even call themselves out to say that they don’t have the full skill set required.&nbsp; And those are employees you want to keep for a long time, even if it means a role change.</p> 
<p>Like me, for instance.&nbsp; I know that in my mind, I dance with as much passion and skill as Alex Wong and could absolutely handle the choreography of Travis Wall.&nbsp; And though I have been known to “get down”, the vision in my mind won’t make it a reality.&nbsp; When I leap around the house with my daughters, they remind me, too, that I might not quite have the skills to dance or to choreograph. &nbsp;Seriously? Have you seen me do the Cha-Cha Slide? Breathtaking.</p>

  95 years ago women earned the right to vote on a national level in the United States. On August 18, 1920, the 
  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Proposal_and_ratification"">Nineteenth Amendment of the US Constitution</a> was ratified. This Amendment prohibited United States citizens from being denied the right to vote based on their gender.
 </div> 
</div> 
<!--more--><hr> 
<blockquote>
 <p><i>""The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.""</i></p>
</blockquote> 
<hr> 
<p><strong>95 years</strong>. It seems like a long time ago, and yet... not really. In the cooperative (co-op for short) where I live there are numerous neighbors of that age or older. The co-op itself was built in the 1920's, so many of its first residents knew what is was like to live under both sets of legal circumstances. Also, that's roughly two generations removed from me. My grandmothers were kids when this went into effect, possibly making them the first women in their respective families to be able to vote. That makes this (in my mind at least) more tangible, and more horrifying as well.</p> 
<p>It probably seems like a no-brainer now, but denying people the right to be full participants in what's considered to be a democratic republic was considered normal and proper at one time. And just because it was ratified doesn't mean that further resistance had to be overcome in order for the Nineteenth Amendment's intended purpose to be fully realized. Enacting a law doesn't necessarily mean it won't be challenged in some way, as evidenced by the use of discriminatory <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Codes_%28United_States%29"">Black Code laws</a> to circumvent legal protections afforded to African Americans following the Civil War.</p> 
<p>Social justice, like any large scale change management process, is imperfect. It requires perseverance, the ability to convincingly articulate the need for change, and thick skin to deal with doubters (and worse). It involves successes (both big and small), and set-backs. It also requires building coalitions amongst those looking to achieve similar goals. Unfortunately, <a href=""http://womenshistory.about.com/library/etext/bl_crisis_1912a.htm"">coalition building is easier said than done</a>.</p> 
<p>As important as all of these qualities are, successful change on the scale of an organization or larger <strong>requires enough people aligned around the change in question</strong>. With regards to the woman's suffrage movement (the driving force behind the Amendment's passage), it took more than the well known efforts and profiles of figures such as Susan B. Anthony, Lucretia Mott, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton to achieve success. It required the efforts, large and small, of people from many backgrounds who believed in the main purpose of the change in question.</p> 
<p>Large scale change can be daunting work. Consider then what the potential impact will be. In the case of the Nineteenth Amendment, it meant that legally, women can now be fully engaged in the American voting process. That change also meant that they could also participate in the economic growth and development of the country. For example, according to <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/WSJExecutiveSummary.pdf"">a 2011 report published by McKinsey and Company</a>, between 1970 and 2009, women went from holding 37% of all jobs to nearly 48%. This increase in workforce participation contributes to the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Giving people the ability to be heard can also impact bottom line results.</p> 
<p>For business leaders looking to make (or may be reluctant to make) deep organizational changes, consider what was accomplished on August 18, 1920.</p> 
<p><strong><i>What sort of impact are you seeking to make?</i></strong></p>

<!--more--><p>We love to watch others mess up, though, don’t we?&nbsp; We are outraged at public figures who make mistakes – small and large – and then have to apologize in public ways.&nbsp; Tiger Woods, Bill Clinton, Michael Phelps, Ariana Grande, Charlie Sheen, Kanye West, Hope Solo, Mel Gibson, Michael Vick, etc. have all had to do it.&nbsp; We hunker down to watch TMZ show us all of the dirt that lead to the apology and then listen to interviews of “professionals” who diagnose the apologies offered.&nbsp; We are sick people.</p> 
<p>On an individual basis, we don’t like being wrong.&nbsp; Usually, it’s because we really don’t think we’re wrong.&nbsp; We choose to put our efforts into defending our position, outlining the course of events that lead to the repercussions and to bringing up the twelve previous wrongs of the “offended” party.&nbsp; We’d rather keep the truth of our wrongdoing to ourselves.</p> 
<p>Consider this: How many people do you think do wrong things daily?&nbsp; Even if 75% of those doing wrong do so on purpose, there are still 25% of those who’ve done wrong without intention.&nbsp; Why should it be hard for 25% of the population to apologize when a mistake is made?&nbsp; FYI – that would be about 1.75 billion people.&nbsp; There would be media coverage and interviews due to the buzz of apology.</p> 
<p>In our businesses, why is the act of apology disproportionate?&nbsp; Specifically, why is it difficult to have senior leadership own their shortcomings?&nbsp; News flash: There are qualified individuals in senior leadership roles who make mistakes.&nbsp; Think about the first time you held a new position.&nbsp; Not just with a new company, but the position itself was new to you.&nbsp; You’d never been a manager before.&nbsp; A director, a VP, or a CEO before.&nbsp; It had to be the first time at some point.&nbsp; Why would anyone think that someone in a new role would get it all right all of the time?&nbsp; Apologies should be expected to come.</p> 
<p>And pride?&nbsp; Please.&nbsp; You’re going to make mistakes.&nbsp; Own them.&nbsp; Your pride can handle it, and if you think it can’t, you shouldn’t be working where you work, or in the role you have…or with people.&nbsp; Own it and say you’re sorry.&nbsp; You cannot really think that you are the first to make an error, do you?&nbsp; You think because you’re a CEO, you will damage your reputation or status as a leader by owning mistakes?&nbsp; Think about what you’re doing to your reputation by not owning the mistakes you’ve made.&nbsp; Everyone knows already; your screw-ups aren’t a secret.</p> 
<p>The other side of the coin is not right either.&nbsp; Don’t you know someone who often begins sentences with, “I’m sorry”?&nbsp; Stop apologizing for so much.&nbsp; When you say you’re sorry all of the time, it’s like crying wolf.&nbsp; It loses its punch and sincerity.&nbsp; What about when you really need to apologize?&nbsp; Won’t it seem like every other sentence?</p> 
<p>Offering the apology is appropriate when something was done wrong.&nbsp; Offering the apology is appropriate when something was received wrongly.&nbsp; Of course your intention is important, but it may not overshadow the way others took what you said/did.&nbsp; The apology, too, does not negate the consequence that may come from your actions.&nbsp; It does, however, set the tone for the consequence and it just might allow others to support you more willingly as you travel that road.</p> 
<p>You may have noticed that the apology is one-sided.&nbsp; Offering it does not mean the response you’d like will come.&nbsp; You may apologize and that offended party may not forgive you.&nbsp; That is not something you can fix.&nbsp; The other party may need time, may need to work things out, may never come around.&nbsp; That’s not your responsibility.&nbsp; Yours is to genuinely say you’re sorry.</p> 
<p>Our staff and leadership need to know they can make mistakes, offer an apology, correct the errors and choose differently moving forward.&nbsp; If the same errors keep happening, even though apologies are offered, it might not be the best role for the person.&nbsp; Repetition is a great teacher both for the individual and the community.&nbsp; Giving people room to learn means mistakes.&nbsp; Giving people room to consistently repeat the same mistakes is foolishness.</p> 
<p>Again, saying your sorry is tough.&nbsp; It’s uncomfortable and awkward.&nbsp; It’s dynamically opposed to our natural inclination.&nbsp; It’s a reminder to us that we’re not perfect.&nbsp; Just remember that we’re all in the same boat.&nbsp; That will help us to offer the apology from a right frame of reference…and maybe to receive it rightly, too.</p>

I’m just curious.”&nbsp; Or a classic favorite of mine, “John, will you be a reference for me as I look for a new job? I love working with you, but I hate it here.”&nbsp; We could share for days all of the various questions we’ve been asked, and trust me that there are some great ones to come still!</p> 
<!--more--><p>One question that’s a bit heart-breaking to be asked by an employee is, “How is it that the people who do the wrong thing (or nothing) get promoted?” &nbsp;This is an unfortunate question for a few reasons.</p> 
<p>First off, what if the person who is promoted is actually a great employee?&nbsp; The perception of this person being less than stellar is shameful, but not necessarily the asking-employee’s fault.&nbsp; Why weren’t the successes of the promoted employee heralded previously?&nbsp; Why didn’t others know of his/her accomplishments or connection to the whole?&nbsp; It’s a sad state of affairs to be good at your work, but not be seen as such.</p> 
<p>Secondly, what if the person promoted hasn’t demonstrated his/her ability clearly?&nbsp; It may not be a matter of poor PR, but rather a matter of hesitancy.&nbsp; What if he/she is able but saw that the climate of the workplace is such that doing your job well would mean scrutiny by others?&nbsp; I have been in workplaces where achievement was frowned upon as it upset the status quo.&nbsp; It was very middle school in its mob mentality, but it was real nonetheless.&nbsp; To show others up (which is how it was taken) was the kiss of death and a very clear hit was put out on you.&nbsp; Other employees would snub you or somehow “forget” to include you in key decisions that affected your workload or process.&nbsp; Sadly, this is more common than you might realize.</p> 
<p>Thirdly, what if the person promoted really is terrible?&nbsp; Is it a matter of sucking up that got this person the promotion?&nbsp; How could this occur?&nbsp; When I was younger in my career, a colleague once told me that “the flakes get promoted to the top.”&nbsp; What a sad statement!&nbsp; Such a phrase doesn’t come from one or two incidents.&nbsp; Who are the people promoting these “flakes” and why do they do it?&nbsp; It’s frustrating to have to deal with the repercussions of such decisions, and it’s usually HR that has to handle the fallout.</p> 
<p>So, how do we handle this?&nbsp; It’s happening right now and is likely to continue to happen in the companies we serve, so our thoughtfulness around an answer is better to consider now.&nbsp; Is it okay to simply say, “I don’t know”?&nbsp; Maybe, but more likely that if this is our answer, we won’t hear from the asking-employee any time in the near future.&nbsp; Why would he/she be inspired to come to us again when we clearly don’t know what’s going on?</p> 
<p>And let’s not forget about tone.&nbsp; Answering “I don’t know” with a sharp or sarcastic tone will minimize our leadership, the leadership of the company as well as the mission of the organization.&nbsp; What kinds of people run this show?&nbsp; Ones that make crappy decisions, who don’t consult HR, who don’t care about the promotee’s influence on work product or culture to date, and who seem to be living in an ivory tower without a connection to what’s really going on.&nbsp; Yup, we can translate all of that in one sarcastic response or disgusted look.&nbsp; We don’t need to add to any bad blood that’s already creeping into relationships.</p> 
<p>It’s important to not be thrown by the question.&nbsp; Someone made this decision.&nbsp; An employee coming to you to ask is correct.&nbsp; Where would you want them to go?&nbsp; It should be you, HR.&nbsp; You should have an idea as to why someone has gotten a promotion.&nbsp; It’s not about justifying it to the asking employee, but more about you portraying confidence.&nbsp; If you know, then you aren’t searching for how to feel about it while in front of this employee.&nbsp; It’s not about agreeing with the decision but about knowing.&nbsp; The time for agreement should have already occurred.&nbsp; If it didn’t, then that isn’t a response that should be shared with the asking-employee.</p> 
<p>I, too, have been in that office when I was asked about someone’s promotion and I had no idea what he/she was talking about.&nbsp; Promoted? Who?!&nbsp; But the trick is to step back and formulate how to approach this.&nbsp; I could be dismissive about the manager who has been making these bad decisions.&nbsp; I could cut down those involved.&nbsp;&nbsp; I could, but I would be very dumb to do so.&nbsp; Rather, I should look for ways to build a bridge.</p> 
<p>Fix what’s wrong in the process. &nbsp;Take initiative, be bold and introduce solutions.&nbsp; Then, when the next question comes, you’ll know how to respond.&nbsp; You can focus back onto the asking-employee and inspire that person in what’s needed to move forward.&nbsp; Many times, the asking-employee just wants to know where he/she fits; it’s not so much about the promoted employee.&nbsp; By knowing what it takes to contribute stronger to the whole and thereby be promoted, allows you to be a resource towards advancement.&nbsp; The questions will continue so make sure the answers flow, too.</p>

<!--more--><p>Uncertainty has its place in relational advancement.&nbsp; Whether it’s a marriage, a career, a church or a team, doubt about your fit for the future is real.&nbsp; This might be unnerving for some, but it’s true.&nbsp; Haven’t you sat back and thought, “Is this the job for me?”&nbsp; Asking the question is healthy. Consideration in areas of usefulness, connection and advancement make sense.&nbsp; Is this company able to utilize me in the ways I would like to, or do I want to give more of myself (time, talents, and treasure) to this company’s mission?&nbsp;&nbsp; The giftedness of the individual and the purpose of the organization should be reviewed for alignment regularly.</p> 
<p>However, it does not mean that it’s a negative position.&nbsp; We have gotten too used to this type of consideration ending in break-up.&nbsp; As such, we’ve believed that even asking the question means it’s over.&nbsp; Ross and Rachel aren’t real, but their relationship (at least as we know) ended in a commitment to each other.&nbsp; Is it only on television that it’s possible?&nbsp; I hope not.</p> 
<p>In our companies, there are daily issues that arise – conflict over management style, turnover, gossip, etc.&nbsp; Professionals should sit back and consider what’s going on.&nbsp; The issues that rise to the top after investigation are addressable.&nbsp; True that one of the ways to address this situation might be termination, but it is not the only option.&nbsp; Sometimes a person has a bad day.&nbsp; Sometimes expectations were not clearly shared.&nbsp; Sometimes there are outside elements to the formula for success that we cannot control.&nbsp; A machete to the relationship is not usually the right answer.</p> 
<p>It is awful to worry when walking into work that Ross or Rachel might ask you for a break.&nbsp; No one seeks this.&nbsp; And yet, it might just be the consideration of future relationship that helps aright a ship’s course.&nbsp; Neither Rachel as a spoiled brat nor Ross as an awkward, self-centered goof was the exclusive reason for the consideration.&nbsp; It added to it, but the deeper questions were ones of support and commitment.&nbsp; These are the same questions employees and employers have for one another.</p> 
<p>As an employee:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Am I valued?</li> 
 <li>How does the company really know what I do or who I am?</li> 
 <li>Am I being taken advantage of? Is that the company’s fault or mine?</li> 
</ul> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As an employer:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Do my employees get why we have the mission we have?</li> 
 <li>Is compensation the only way my employees receive affirmation?&nbsp;Have we allowed this to be true, if so?</li> 
 <li>Am I holding back on resources because I fear my employees will leave?</li> 
</ul> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Of course, there are more questions to ask on either side of the table, but these catch some of the initial consideration that should happen.&nbsp; Relationships, whether between two people or between a person and his/her company, take thought.&nbsp; Think through why you might not be connecting as you once had.&nbsp; Termination, as divorce or resignation, is the swifter option, but may be the less than ideal long term response.&nbsp; Step back and question.</p> 
<p>The uncertainty ought to lead to clarity.&nbsp; Results from the clarity might vary, but the confidence to follow through will be stronger.&nbsp; Having been through the questioning process will give you peace knowing that you really thought through this, which is confidence-producing.&nbsp; Uncertainty has a particular nuance of excitement to it as it offers the opportunity to relent to “not knowing” what to do.&nbsp; If your response were to be perfect each time, where are the opportunities to learn?&nbsp; By having the uncertainty, we get to step back and research our companies, our relationships, and ourselves.</p> 
<p>Ross and Rachel didn’t corner the market on relational uncertainty.&nbsp; It’s been appealing to us as viewers of movies and television, as readers of novels, as writers of stories.&nbsp; Plot lines revolve around relationships and have for centuries.&nbsp; Turn off the “Friends” reruns and pick up a Shakespeare play…any will do.&nbsp; Wherefore art thou, Ross?</p>

<!--more--><p>I recently saw a story about a boy, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-NXguyFFko"">Walker</a>, who broke his arm and was in the hospital to address the situation.&nbsp; When Walker awoke, he saw that he broke a bone.&nbsp; Instead of dread and disappointment, Walker couldn’t get over his excitement in having a cast.&nbsp; He began to ask everyone in the room if they’d seen his cast.&nbsp; He was elated in the difficulty (okay,, the drugs helped, but...).&nbsp; How much is Walker teaching us about approaching annoyance, inconvenience, frustration?</p> 
<p>In human resources, we’re asked to deal with many annoyances.&nbsp; We are to point others to a better (not bitter) way of handling emotion and its impact on work.&nbsp; This isn’t to belittle the true feelings that someone may have, but rather to enable a healthy perspective.&nbsp; The disappointment felt can be crippling to some.&nbsp; We can draw on our own experiences to help guide others.</p> 
<p>When a new problem enters my life, do I ask others in pure joy if they see this opportunity given to me, as Walker did with his arm?&nbsp; Do I present it as a privilege?&nbsp; This isn’t about positive self-help crappola (that’s Italian for “crap”).&nbsp; It’s about dealing with two realities – people and opportunities to grow.</p> 
<p>Growth is easier.&nbsp; Think about the disappointments that you’ve experienced in life – lost jobs, bad relationships, financial struggle, even death.&nbsp; What did you learn from each of those experiences?&nbsp; While I don’t wish any of those situations on anyone, I am sure that there was an opportunity to grow in action, consideration and relationship.</p> 
<p>A proactive approach to an unwelcome reality takes discipline and effort.&nbsp; I can choose not to learn anything from the situation in front of me.&nbsp; I can choose to sit in a corner and weep.&nbsp; I can choose to remain in that corner for days, weeks, even if not literally.&nbsp; My spirit sits crushed inside of me and I accept the victimization.&nbsp; Well-intentioned people get hit with life and all that it has to offer.&nbsp; I have watched some rise to the occasion and some fall to the wayside.</p> 
<p>In business, I have sat with executives who’ve lost everything.&nbsp; I have cried with staff that I had to reduce.&nbsp; I have packed boxes for companies that had to close.&nbsp; I have been to the funerals of co-workers who died suddenly, leaving young families behind.</p> 
<p>Expectation setting is one of the hardest mechanisms against disappointment.&nbsp; This is where the people component comes into play.&nbsp; I know that I have disappointed others and I know I am not done disappointing.&nbsp; It’s not that I intend to do so, but the expectations of others are not ones that I can control.&nbsp; Some have expected me to fail, and I didn’t.&nbsp; Some have expected me to soar, and I didn’t.&nbsp; In both situations, disappointment was there.</p> 
<p>Am I adding to that disappointment by fueling such expectations that others have for me?&nbsp; Is it okay for me to address what I think others expect?&nbsp; If you want to mitigate disappointment, then absolutely yes.&nbsp; Walk into a team meeting and let others know what you’re sensing for expectations around a particular situation.&nbsp; If they always think you’re to be the hero, is that fair?&nbsp; Is that pressure yours to hold?&nbsp; Aren’t you exhausted by all of the balls in the air?</p> 
<p>Understand that the personal nature of some of this is very relevant in business.&nbsp; We project personal feelings of disappointment on others.&nbsp; When I work with a company that’s being sued by its own employees, it hurts.&nbsp; There is no denying that, but does that business want to stay in business?&nbsp; If so, then it cannot wallow in pity and despair.&nbsp; Get up, understand that the expectations you had for that handful of employees was off, and work to make the company better today.&nbsp; Direct your energies towards things that will give a return; don't settle for pure emotion.</p> 
<p>Listen, I am a crier (shocking to some, I know, but true).&nbsp; I am a sucker for an emotionally charged commercial…where are the tissues?&nbsp; My sensitive heart busts through my chest sometimes.&nbsp; But that emotion may not be just about sappy sentiment, but also real disappointment and anger based on what I am seeing. &nbsp;Previous experiences get brought to the surface based upon that movie, show or commercial. &nbsp;I make connections in my mind.</p> 
<p>These emotions and responses are mine to control.&nbsp; Similarly, in work,&nbsp;I cannot expect a positive outcome if I project my disappointment on others. “Oh, if only so-and-so wasn’t here. It would so much easier to deal with work.”&nbsp; Really?&nbsp; Why give this person so much power in your life?&nbsp; Why did you think you could expect a certain behavior from “so-and-so”?&nbsp; Whose fault is that?</p> 
<p>You should not desire to be a stumbling block to anyone, but know that it is likely to happen, as it has previously.&nbsp; Intention is fine, but the reality as to how others respond cannot be overlooked.&nbsp; Disappointment is going to happen.&nbsp; It’s about how you will deal with it and what it does to your life.&nbsp; Existing is no way to live.</p> 
<p>Manage your expectations of others and know that there are certain things in life which are going to happen.&nbsp; Death, taxes…and disappointment.&nbsp; Rise above and use it to fuel health in all facets of your life.</p>

<!--more--><p>How many Hoosiers, Miracle, Rudy, (insert one of a zillion other movie greats) speeches can we give?&nbsp; Those speeches are delivered at a moment in time.&nbsp; Our desire is to make that moment last when we know it cannot.&nbsp; That’s why it’s a moment.&nbsp; It’s why The Mighty Ducks 3 isn’t as inspiring as the first (C’mon, you weren’t inspired by the first one?)</p> 
<p>Effective inspiration consists of a deliberate balance between moments and the cultural training that occurs as a result of those moments.&nbsp; Cultural training?&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; Everyday, leadership instills an understanding of how things are, ought to be and will be.&nbsp; Leaders deliver unspoken words of “don’t touch, don’t ask, don’t even think about it” as much as they deliver “please do, please ask, please engage.”&nbsp; The context becomes clearer to employees as to when those messages are applied.&nbsp; A culture then develops through the understanding of what can be and who is demonstrating “right” behavior.</p> 
<p>When we deliver inspiring thoughts and a call to action, we do so in the context of the culture.&nbsp; If we say “Let’s go get ‘em” enough but are unable to “get ‘em” then we deliver a message that cannot be met.&nbsp; Failure is okay; repeated failure means it can’t be done or you’re not the one who can do it.&nbsp; And so, culturally, if we tell our team to keep going despite the inability to reach, we show that we don’t know our people, process or product.&nbsp; The inspiring words are foolishness.</p> 
<p>I find myself consistently saying “Know your audience.”&nbsp; Inspiration is lost on those who’ve heard it before and seen no action.&nbsp; If, as a leader, you don’t realize the attitude in your culture, then no one is following you.&nbsp; How are you a leader?&nbsp; There is no influence happening.</p> 
<p>Our intention to motivate is real.&nbsp; Ultimately, we want employees to be inspired to greatness (if you don’t, you should seriously think about changing careers or changing your attitude, bearing in mind that changing roles still brings your attitude with you).&nbsp; We have a workforce that wants to be the hero.&nbsp; We can inspire them to that with messaging, tools and process that set them up for success.</p> 
<p>Inspiration becomes emotionally charged very easily.&nbsp; That trap is attractive.&nbsp; It’s feelings-oriented and it presents itself as effective in that moment.&nbsp; We’ve all done it in our attempt to encourage and push.</p> 
<p>Let’s change the perspective and work to change culture through appropriate cultural impact.&nbsp; Are competencies there?&nbsp; Are processes ready to handle the effect of inspiration?&nbsp; Is messaging consistent and thoughtful?&nbsp; Simply, again, are we setting others up for success?&nbsp; That’s what is truly inspiring and will give a return for quite some time.&nbsp; Go Ducks!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>""Looking back, the thing that's really impressive is that here were these leaders running the Civil War, and people...had time to meditate on the day's events...They weren't multi-tasking; they had time to reflect. It's a luxury many leaders just don't have today, and that's a real loss.""</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above quote is by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doris_Kearns_Goodwin"">Doris Kearns Goodwin</a>, author and historian, in the April 2009 edition of the Harvard Business Review. The entire article is great and this quote struck me in particular.</p>
<p>I'm a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_worker"">knowledge worker</a>. My job involves utilizing large amounts of information and making decisions that support the goals of the organization I work with. Some are straightforward while others requires a fair amount of analysis and consideration.</p>
<p>When it comes to strategic initiatives, it can be all too easy to go with what worked in the past, without considering how it may impact the present. This is where the danger lies. Considering the fast paced world most of us live in it's important that we take the time to reflect on what we do and did, both professionally as well as personally.</p>
<p>It's also important that these <strong>reflections be recorded</strong>. I know that sounds obvious but think about it--how much of your organizational member's unique knowledge is accessible--to other staff, vendors, and partners?</p>
<p>For example, in a former role I managed the annual update to the employee handbook. My partners and I made policy decisions that impacted thousands of employees. It was also my responsibility to communicate what changes had been made and why. Part of the strategy in accomplishing this was by saving the previous drafts of employee manuals that were created over the years, along with a supporting notes and communications generated. As a result, we became much better at determining which policies were effective and which weren't.<br>Having these reflections on record also help to preserve and perpetuate an organization's unique culture, which is often underrated and should not be taken lightly. I know that many people argue that a job's a job, but all things being equal, people tend to choose organizations that reflect their professional or personal values.</p>
<p>Another way to look at it is like this--<strong>if your top talent got killed tomorrow would their best practices, leadership decisions, etc., die along with them?</strong> It's morbid, I know, but I'm trying to make a point. This is why when <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs#Health_issues"">Steve Jobs took a leave of absence</a> in 2009 people started to wonder if it signaled an end of an era at Apple (as well as rattle shareholder confidence). When employees who represent the best of a company's values and vision leaves it can have an effect on morale and productivity. Preserving their output for others to access helps to minimize the loss of critical resources.</p>
<p>Here are a few suggestions on being better at self reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Set aside (idle) time for yourself.</strong> Too often we use what little free time we have to do more stuff. Give yourself time and permission to do nothing, within reason. And stick to it the same way you stick to your other commitments.</li>
<li><strong>Stay healthy.</strong> Numerous medical studies show that a good diet and regular exercise have a positive impact on brain functions. It also helps with stress management, making it easier to think more clearly.</li>
<li><strong>Write it down!</strong> This is the one I struggle with the most. I'll have a great idea and by the time I'm ready to implement it I've forgotten the most crucial elements (Doh!). So now I carry around a pen and a notepad to jot things down in the moment. It damages my street cred but it preserves my thoughts.</li>
<li><strong>Promote and utilize collaborative tools within your organization.</strong> Wikis, blogs, and intranets are some of the tools that may be used by organizations for capturing its members knowledge. It's important that they're easy to use and are supported by top management.</li>
<li><strong>Share.</strong> Aside from colleagues, you should try to speak with those outside your normal comfort zone. Remember, you're responsible to all stakeholders. Being able to effectively explain yourself to them (and vice-versa) will only benefit you.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to continue to make quality decisions then take the time to reflect and share this insight with others. Without it you could be missing important opportunities for yourself and your organization.</p>

<!--more--><p>Sound a bit like work?&nbsp; Think of the trouble caused by misunderstanding, to start.&nbsp; Often, I hear the following:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>I&nbsp;didn’t know that was what he was asking me to do</li> 
 <li>Wait, you meant for me to do that this week?</li> 
 <li>I think my boss is trying to make me look bad on purpose</li> 
 <li>How can I be expected to do anything more? No one knows all of what I do</li> 
</ul> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Lack of clarity around process, personnel and results often find themselves into our daily &nbsp;“issue board.”&nbsp; You know, that growing list of concerns or problems brought up by misunderstanding.&nbsp; Think of the extra meetings you’ve had to bridge the gaps towards understanding.&nbsp; Lots, right?</p> 
<p>I recall one particular time where I calculated 15 hours of my 40-hour work week spent on meetings I had not planned on having in order to mediate the trouble that was brewing surrounding misunderstanding, unrealized expectations and a general lack of grace towards each other.&nbsp; That was 37.5% of my work week.&nbsp; Productive?&nbsp; Maybe.&nbsp; Could it have been avoided to begin with?&nbsp; Much of it could have been.</p> 
<p>I know that there is much to learn through situations like this.&nbsp; The “a-ha” moments usually come when someone, who has worked himself/herself into a tizzy, finds out that the “facts” he/she thought were off and it causes a reconsideration of how information is gathered and processed.&nbsp; It’s a beautiful thing to watch.&nbsp; And yet, if you find yourself in multiple situations like that, doesn’t that show more of a systemic issue?</p> 
<p>Trouble is a difficult culture to break through.&nbsp; There are some companies that love it.&nbsp; They thrive on unhealthy relationships, difficult processes and a sloppy organizational design. &nbsp;That’s not a dramatic statement.&nbsp; Considering the amount of books, articles and workshops on dealing with toxic co-workers, difficult bosses and a separatist board of directors, it’s very reasonable to see that many companies must swim in this description and many of us deal with this on a regular basis.</p> 
<p>As leaders, we ought to be proactive to thwart trouble before it begins.&nbsp; We can offer direction on process, wisdom in relational dealings and passion behind seeking resolution directly.&nbsp; It’s not meant to be emotionless, but it’s often the case that a culture allowed to be too emotional can end up being crippled by those emotions and fall short of the mission.&nbsp; We can encourage folks to move beyond such short-sightedness.&nbsp; The feeling is not where the prize is found; it’s in reaching the goal.</p> 
<p>Consider marriage.&nbsp; The wedding itself is a fun day.&nbsp; It’s a party!&nbsp; There is much to love and feel good about; however, the marriage itself is the goal.&nbsp; Emotions won’t be in the same sphere each day as compared to the wedding.&nbsp; If the marriage is based on the desire to feel the way they did on the wedding day, the marriage is doomed.&nbsp; And so it is with business.&nbsp; Not every day is the first day of work; not every day is the first sale made; not every day is the holiday party.&nbsp; In between are days where a lack of clarity, issues around process and general trouble can occur.&nbsp; Taking a proactive stance to thwart such problems and to add value to the communicative process so that others can perform it without you is our job.</p> 
<p>Open the dialogue, call others to a higher standard and bring issues out into the open with the purpose of educating, diffusing and moving on.&nbsp; Trouble festers if left unattended.&nbsp; Don’t let it happen. &nbsp;You can make such an impact.&nbsp; I mean, if Laverne and Shirley were able to do it in a 30-minute time slot, I have faith that you can get it done in a timely manner.&nbsp; Sclemeel, schlemazel, hasenfeffer incorporated to all!</p>

<!--more--><p>You just need to know one simple thing; what is ""The Reason"" for creating one for your company.</p>
<p>Let's face it. &nbsp;Some business owners are extremely interested in putting a lot of money away for retirement and taking advantage of as many tax deductions as possible. &nbsp; In a perfect world, a business owner could do this while receiving a tax break from the government at the same time without limitations. &nbsp;Unfortunately, there are caps to what you can do and it depends on what plan you choose. &nbsp;On the other hand, a business may be solely focused on enhancing the benefits they are offering to their employees. &nbsp;The company may see a retirement plan as a way of keeping their employees around and also attracting new ones as well.</p>
<p>I could bore you with all of the details that go along with a SEP IRA, Simple IRA, and 401k plan but if anything else you have to first realize that these plans allow contributions to increase to a level much higher than an individual IRA. &nbsp;In 2015, the traditional IRA contribution limits are $5,500 and $6,500 if age 50 or older. &nbsp;The limit allows for a decent contribution but a business retirement plan such as a SEP IRA allows for contributions up to $52,000 in 2015. Now that is a huge difference. &nbsp;If you put that amount against a 30% tax bracket, you would receive over $15,000 in tax savings in just this year alone. If your company has many employees or is likely to grow, a 401k/ Profit sharing plan might be more suitable. &nbsp;You will have the flexibility to decide if you want to invest more or less each year and can limit the benefits provided to the employees based on actuarial testing.</p>
<p>There are many factors that affect how a retirement plan will work including the age of employees, the number of employees, the salaries of employees and the contribution amount of the employer(s). This is why a decision should not be rushed. &nbsp;A Simple IRA plan, for example, does not allow for higher contribution limits compared to other business plans but the out of pocket cost is less for the employer to set up.</p>
<p>Retirement plans are great ways to really improve your company. &nbsp;The business owner(s) can really take advantage of putting money away and the employees are also set up to come along for the ride. Think about it. When else does the government hook you up with a discount on taxes for saving your own money. By the way, they also let your money grow tax free before withdrawals. Not a bad situation if you are able to contribute steadily throughout your working career.</p>
<p>So, first start with ""The Reason"" you are considering a plan. From there, it will be a lot easier to figure out what fits your company's needs.</p>

<!--more--><p>The marketplace is ravenous for leadership-directed material.&nbsp; I have been known to write about it.&nbsp; I have been known to coach leaders on leadership.&nbsp; I lead one of the premier HR consulting firms – Humareso.&nbsp; I like leadership.</p> 
<p>Sadly, however, over the past decade, I hear many complaining that our need for leadership is thwarted by a lack of desire for people to step into leadership.&nbsp; Let me be clearer.&nbsp; We’ve all experienced leaders who had no business being in positions of leadership.&nbsp; They were cruel, cold, uninspiring, lacked vision or narcissistic.&nbsp; Many couldn’t manage their way out of a paper bag let alone lead anyone anywhere (ok, so I have some strong feelings about bad leaders, I know).</p> 
<p>Perhaps because of those bad leaders, we have many who could perform the role of leader who won’t do it.&nbsp; They’ve seen the bloody battle that erupts around leaders.&nbsp; They see the accolades, sure, but they see the bathroom wall writing, too.&nbsp; It’s a reputation-killer in our society to be a leader.&nbsp; Can we honestly blame people for not wanting to lead?</p> 
<p>Or perhaps it’s Marvel’s fault.&nbsp; We hold up high the myth of the super hero who can come in and lead effectively with character and right action.&nbsp; Those movies are blockbusters, but do they set us up to think that all leadership should look like Captain America?&nbsp; It’s a fantasy.&nbsp; Could it be that our fascination with that genre impacts our willingness to jump into leadership? &nbsp;Could be.</p> 
<p>So what do businesses do?&nbsp; They are so starved for leadership that money and willingness become tied together.&nbsp; Begging someone to lead and paying that person handsomely is our charge to motivate.&nbsp; I agree that our leadership should be compensated for the skill sets, aptitudes and knowledge they possess.&nbsp; However, if we bypass those qualities in favor of willingness to hold a position, we belittle the intention of leadership.&nbsp; Instead of influencers towards mission, we box bodies into short-term, high-paying figureheads. &nbsp;&nbsp;That doesn’t seem too appealing.</p> 
<p>If someone has some of the qualities necessary to build upon for a leadership role, it’s our job to help coach them into the role, not scare them off.&nbsp; Promoting people because you can is not a successful succession plan.&nbsp; True leadership is of a different path.&nbsp; Leadership is about influence, yes, but deeper than that, a leader inspires others to push and reach for their excellence individually and corporately.&nbsp; A leader rallies people toward a challenge or lasting goal.</p> 
<p>One of our passions is to ridicule and belittle our leadership.&nbsp; We leave them little room to grow from their mistakes.&nbsp; The title of leader does not and should not imply perfection.&nbsp; No one fully arrives once given a role like that.&nbsp; Regardless of your political persuasion, look at the way we’ve beaten up our last six presidents (and please, don’t send me any articles as to why Bush or Obama or Clinton are more awful than others).&nbsp; I wouldn’t want any of my kids to be president, and that’s a sad statement.</p> 
<p>If I were president, I would receive a barrage of criticism just like they did.&nbsp; And while that’s on a grand scale, the smaller version is just as powerful in our workplaces.&nbsp; It’s why we struggle to find people willing to step up.&nbsp; And so our succession plans move from who is able to who is willing.&nbsp; There is a vast difference between the two.</p> 
<p>Some of you reading this know I am talking to you.&nbsp; You know that you have the ability to lead, but won’t jump in.&nbsp; You’ve seen how other leaders have been devoured by their own.&nbsp; I know it’s not pretty.&nbsp; Leadership, however, is a privilege that costs.&nbsp; It’s not that you will become a leader and now be free from ridicule because you’ll have them read this blog.&nbsp; That’s not what will work.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>What will work is your relentless pursuit of excellence, your drive to encourage those you lead towards the mission and your creative exuberance towards the vision.&nbsp; Some will not like to see this type of person leading them.&nbsp; It’s too active, too forward thinking, too expectant.&nbsp; I would say that’s too bad for them.&nbsp; You are made from deeper and richer stuff.&nbsp; Don’t fear leadership and what might come with taking it; rather, fear what a lack of leadership will do for a spirit such as yours.</p>

<!--more--><div class=""separator""></div> 
<p>I get approached regularly with requests for career advice. I get asked all sorts of questions but they tend to be variations on the following:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li><i>How do I break into Human Resources?</i></li> 
 <li><i>How do I use social media to build my brand?</i></li> 
 <li><i>What help can you give me to find a job?</i></li> 
 <li><i><b>Victorio, why are you so cool?</b></i></li> 
</ul> 
<p>I admit that the last one, while my favorite, is false! The others aren't.</p> 
<p>I can sympathize; I've been in that position, one where I felt clueless about an important question I needed answers to, or a choice that I needed to make. As a result, I do my best to help people out. Usually I start with an email exchange and then if they're comfortable we'll move on to a phone conversation. If they live or plan to be in New York City then we can meet in person. Through this process of communication I've helped people figure out next steps in their professional lives, as well as developed some great relationships.</p> 
<p>As I mentioned, I've felt clueless. I still feel that way sometimes. I don't have all of the answers, nor do I want to. <i>Having challenging questions to answer is part of the learning process as a professional</i>. For me, it drives me to better understand and articulate my passion for Human Resources, along with how I can support my clients in the best possible fashion.</p> 
<p>I also recognize that, while I consider myself smart, capable, and creative, I'm not the smartest, most capable, or creative Human Resources professional in the world. As <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Joy"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Bill Joy</a>, computer scientist and co-founder of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Sun Microsystems</a>, once said:</p> 
<blockquote>
 <p><i><b>“No matter how many smart people there are within your firm, remember that there are far more smart people outside your firm.”</b></i></p>
</blockquote> 
<p>It's important to remember this. Even if you yourself are an expert in your respective field, there are others out there just as capable, if not more so. And in this era where top talent and resources can be accessed from almost anywhere, it pays to recognize when to reach beyond your known environment for advice and expertise.</p> 
<p>This is part of what leaders do--gather intelligence, as well as assess its quality and relevance to the issue at hand, in order to make informed decisions. Without the ability to ask, as well as the willingness to reach out to those within and outside a person's comfort zone, people may not have the relevant insight, perspective, or information necessary to make good decisions.</p> 
<p>Competitive advantage can come from timely access to information and expertise, not necessarily being the source of it. Approaching people for help isn't a sign of weakness, neither is asking questions. When done correctly, it demonstrates an ability to seek out and make quality decisions based on the best information available.</p> 
<p><i>How do you ask for help?</i></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<!--more--><p>Most times, I laugh.&nbsp; I get up from my seat while laughing.&nbsp; Place my hand nicely on the shoulder of the requester and laugh as I slightly escort the person out of my area.&nbsp; I don’t respond verbally.&nbsp; Just laughter.&nbsp; I do this because if I let myself say what I would want to say, I would be out of a job.</p> 
<p>What I know will help to alleviate many of these situations, though not all, is the connection to basic needs.&nbsp; People have needs.&nbsp; In the workplace, what can we do about it?&nbsp; Ideally, we can address them and set them up for success.&nbsp; It takes a little work.&nbsp; It might undo a culture completely.&nbsp; It might cause everyone to see how unhealthy things have been.&nbsp; So what?&nbsp; Productivity improvements are connected to the people we employ.&nbsp; Set up standards that allow for goals to be achieved while motivating staff and meeting their needs, and you would be a hero.</p> 
<p>So, what do people really want?</p> 
<ul> 
 <li><strong>Collaboration</strong> – the ability to work with others. Relationship is a natural desire of humans.&nbsp; Some love it more than others, but we’re all wired for it.&nbsp; Creativity, ingenuity and resourcefulness are enhanced through collaborative efforts</li> 
 <li><strong>Invested Leadership</strong> – seeing the leaders of the organization take an interest in the goings-on of a work group and/or an individual contributor.&nbsp; A manager of a small group of employees portrays an understanding of the culture of leadership every day.&nbsp; Leadership is to take a vested interest in the people it employs.&nbsp; This gives employees an understanding of fit and of connection to the mission</li> 
 <li><strong>Viability in Advancement</strong> – is there really a chance to advance in the organization?&nbsp; We often say that there is, but employees figure out rather quickly whether that’s going to be true or not.&nbsp; The real trajectory within an organization should be evaluated.&nbsp; Providing a path for real advancement in usage of skill sets, knowledge and relationship motivates an employee towards a sense of purpose</li> 
 <li><strong>Compensation </strong>– salary, commission, bonus, PTO, benefits, retirement, etc. are a reality of living.&nbsp; Our staff have homes, apartments, significant others, families, a social life, vacations, holidays for which to pay and enjoy.&nbsp; Compensation allows an employee to handle some of the bottom levels of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs so that the more analytical level is addressed</li> 
 <li><strong>Impact </strong>– simply, is what an employee doing impacting the purpose of the group?&nbsp; When we challenge the status quo and (re-)introduce the concept of impact, we wake people up.&nbsp; What each employee does allows a product to be delivered, a service to be given, or a resource to be offered while changing processes, enhancing knowledge and keeping the lights on!&nbsp; The line worker who is placing four screws on the same piece on the assembly line is a superstar.&nbsp; Those four screws hold something significant together.&nbsp; No task or role is small</li> 
</ul> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>If you’re a leader, not matter how small your charge, sit with this list and evaluate what’s going on at your company.&nbsp; Now evaluate what you are doing to move towards meeting these needs.&nbsp; Be practical.</p> 
<p>And I would be remiss not to point out that there is a grand difference between need and want.&nbsp; An employee might ask for what he/she wants and try to cloak it as a need.&nbsp; Rip the sheet off of that want.&nbsp; Expose it.&nbsp; Time off is a need.&nbsp; Six weeks of vacation a year is a want.&nbsp; Just because someone asks for it, doesn’t make it a need.</p> 
<p>There are days I need people to leave me alone.&nbsp; And then I am reminded that is a want.&nbsp; So, now what?&nbsp; Oh, I know.&nbsp; I will rephrase it.&nbsp; “I want people to leave me alone some days.”&nbsp; That’s better.&nbsp; Now, what do I do about the HR career and people thing?&nbsp; Crap.</p>

<!--more--><p>In the workplace, structure is just as imperative.&nbsp; Have you ever worked for a company that is a bit of a free-for-all?&nbsp; Holy guacamole, is that frustrating or what?&nbsp; I mean, who is getting stuff done?&nbsp; I’ve watched employees meander from one cubicle to another discussing all sorts of stuff, whether work related or not, as if life is one big latte.&nbsp; Even the professionals at Google and URBN have structure, people!&nbsp; Not everyone is walking around with a dog, a cappuccino and a copy of “The Fountainhead” while wearing Toms (if you’re walking around work like that as you read this, um…sorry).</p> 
<p>Process points to purpose.&nbsp; Giving structure in various areas of duty, responsibility and performance shows care.&nbsp; Employees want to know they fit and are contributing.&nbsp; Honestly, they don’t really want to wander.&nbsp; It does no one any good if an employee lacks the structure to do his/her job.&nbsp; Further, it actually dumbs down the skill set he/she has.&nbsp; Without practice and use, it will atrophy and weaken.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In high school, I was on the track team.&nbsp; My favorite event to compete in was the long jump.&nbsp; While I cannot say that I was the best on the team (because that would be a lie), I can say that I practiced daily.&nbsp; I ran down the long jump runway into a pit of sand dozens of times each day.&nbsp; I practiced sprinting so that my speed improved to catapult me further in my jump.&nbsp; I practiced on hurdles so that my “ups” would improve for takeoff from the long jump board.&nbsp; I lifted weights and stretched to strengthen those muscles needed for the in-air motion to extend my jump distance.&nbsp; And I knew to do this because my coach gave me structure.&nbsp; He led me and my teammates through the process of working out, through drills, through conditioning…in the cold, in the heat…daily.</p> 
<p>Without the cliché, anything worth striving for has to be practiced and pursued consistently.&nbsp; Michael Phelps didn’t just happen to win all of those Olympic medals because he has a few good weeks over 12 years.&nbsp; He devoted himself to the structure needed to win.&nbsp; Our staff has to be invested in similarly.&nbsp; We need to have process in place for skill improvement, for discipline, for praise, for critique, for job enlargement, for job enrichment.&nbsp; We can lead them through the structure of career advancement within our organizations.&nbsp; We can offer resources to help them handle the processes better.</p> 
<p>Having structure is not the enemy.&nbsp; Having purposeless structure, however, is demotivating and can lead an organization to think the structure is the enemy.&nbsp; What is the structure like where you are?&nbsp; Does it need improvement?&nbsp; Is it just not known and so a different tactic for communication has to happen?&nbsp; Are staff members afraid to offer some process improvement?&nbsp; Do they even know how to report improvement suggestions?</p> 
<p>Perhaps you can take time this weekend while you are working out to think through one area that needs structure or needs it enhanced or needs it communicated better.&nbsp; Yeah, I know, I am making an assumption that you’ll workout this weekend.&nbsp; Maybe I am pushing you a bit.&nbsp; Maybe it’s time for this structure to be placed into your life.&nbsp; Maybe I will find myself back on the track this weekend working on my long jump skills.&nbsp; Maybe.</p>

When I am referred to as the warm, huggy HR guy (stop laughing, it still happens once in a while), I smile.&nbsp; I mean, it’s certainly better than being seen as the obnoxious, pencil-pushing, rule-following, do-gooder HR guy.&nbsp; And while I don’t think that my career has hinged on my positivity, it certainly hasn’t hurt it!</p> 
<!--more--><p>Yes, I’ve done the birthday parties, the collection of funds for the family of a recently deceased employee, the bridal shower, the retirement dinners and countless company holiday parties.&nbsp; And you know what?&nbsp; It’s okay.&nbsp; I’m not Martha Stewart.&nbsp; I’m not David Tutera.&nbsp; I’m not on the panel of The Chew.&nbsp; But, I am willing.</p> 
<p>Approaching the fullness of the HR role with a willing, positive spirit invites others in.&nbsp; It can opens doors for conversation and perspective-sharing that may not have otherwise occurred.&nbsp; I have learned much from employees when we’re working on a project together.&nbsp; Years ago, I worked on a “prom” being held during the summer for a group of temporary workers, as a thank you for their efforts.&nbsp; It was hilarious.&nbsp; Everyone went to a thrift shop and got awful tuxedos and bad bridesmaid dresses.&nbsp; We laughed and laughed as pictures were taken under the balloon arch that we made.&nbsp; And yet, one of the best parts of the whole thing was how much I got to know other staff who helped me get this craziness together.&nbsp; We spent time decorating, making picture frame gifts for each employee, etc., which all allowed for conversation.&nbsp; I learned so much about facets of the company, of process, of the good others were doing that I would not have had reason to know otherwise.</p> 
<p>I know, I know.&nbsp; Many of you are saying, “OK, Baldino, you’re always telling me not to just be the party-planner.&nbsp; What gives here?”&nbsp; My answer is that you’re right.&nbsp; I don’t want you to be JUST the party-planner.&nbsp; But that does not mean you shouldn't be a part of it.&nbsp; An organization’s cultural improvement and enhancement is going to need leadership…that’s us, HR.&nbsp; Don’t be afraid.&nbsp; Love the chance to foster team through these opportunities.</p> 
<p>And be authentically positive.&nbsp; There’s so much in our world that is tough, draining, annoyingly compliant (if ACA, FMLA and the like don’t make you want to pull your hair out, you have issues).&nbsp; Leverage opportunities for proactive organizational investment through positive approach with defined plans.&nbsp; Too many of us walk into these opportunities with the look of “I have to” on our faces.&nbsp; You won’t get the type of return possible with that kind of attitude. &nbsp;Find the genuine reasons to be encouraged which will allow you to display the positivity needed.</p> 
<p>Sometimes, the crankiest person in the department becomes your best friend after a shared experience.&nbsp; There’s nothing like sharing hot dogs, beers and fries at a baseball game to bond people (at least for me).&nbsp; Create memories, encourage camaraderie and set the mood for laughter.</p> 
<p>Take stock of your demeanor.&nbsp; I know how entitled you are to be pissed.&nbsp; I get that most of the people you see each day suck the life out of you.&nbsp; I am aware that you’ve had to cover the butts of people in the office for years.&nbsp; Keep it in check.&nbsp; Ever think what others are thinking of you?&nbsp; Do you think you’re alone in categorizing and judging others?&nbsp; Someone has to stop the carousel of negativity.&nbsp; We are the cultural ambassadors of our organizations.</p> 
<p>Take hold of that role and don’t apologize for the smile on your face.&nbsp; No one should steal your joy.&nbsp; I’m <em>positive</em> that you can do this (see what I did there?).</p>

<p>Like many people, I can appreciate a good magic trick. When I was growing up television specials featuring performers such as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Copperfield_%28illusionist%29"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">David Copperfield</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Henning"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Doug Henning</a>, as well as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penn_and_Teller"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Penn and Teller</a> were regular events. And in New York City you can actually walk down the street and run across street performers doing some pretty cool things.</p> 
<p>Part of how a trick works is that its mechanics are hidden from the audience. Whether its card tricks or displays of disappearing damsels, part of the fun (and what makes the magic, <i>magic</i>) is attempting to answer the question,<br> Most magicians, understandably, don't tell you how they performed their tricks. Part of it is personal--a unique trick helps to differentiate one performer from another. Part of that reasoning is financial. If you reveal too much the audience loses interest and they stop paying to see you perform. David Copperfield, aside from being a talented illusionist, was also a wealthy one. He had a vested interest in making sure no one could decipher his tricks, going so far as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Copperfield_%28illusionist%29#Litigation"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">to sue author Herbert L. Becker</a> to prevent him from publishing a book in which he reveals magicians' tricks, including his own.</p> 
<p>Aside from the above, huge part of why magician's don't reveal their tricks is that <i>it ruins the trick</i>. For all that the audience may want to know, there's a part of them that doesn't. <i>Magic lies in the audience's willing suspension of disbelief.</i> We know that people can't pull coins out of our ears, or that pretty ladies can't be sawed in half and still live, or that the Statue of Liberty really disappeared. But we're still delighted by the trick. Very few people (Penn and Teller and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_Jay"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Ricky Jay</a> are two that come to mind for me) can be transparent as well as entertaining.</p> 
<p>In the customer service world a lot has changed. Yet satisfying consumer demand hasn't, it's only increased. Consumers have a variety of different ways to gather information about a brand. And company's feel pressured to reveal as much about themselves as reasonable, lest others do it for them. ""Engagement"" is the mantra of today. Having a presence online (whether to provide information, interact with others, or to allow customers to shop) is an important and ever growing part of a company's strategy. Rating systems, customer review sites, blogs that are for or against a certain brand make it seem that, in essence, customers are less willing to suspend their disbelief. With the amount of information produced and disseminated online it's increasingly difficult for an organization to provide a magical experience.</p> 
<p>As a Consultant, I'm not providing customer service in the same fashion as a Barista at Starbucks. I do however attempt to utilize my knowledge, skills and abilities in a similar fashion for the clients I work with. They have demands of me that I attempt to meet, and I endeavor do so in a fashion that goes above and beyond simply performing a transaction. I also work with organizations whose focus is to provide services to a particular audience. So part of my mission is supporting the client's attempt at delivering a magical experience.</p> 
<p>What can organizations and consultants do to ensure great customer service experiences? Here are a few suggestions:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li><b>Understand and focus on your strengths. Some magicians can perform a variety of different tricks. Generally speaking, many tend to focus on a particular form of magic. Some are illusionists, others are great at slight-of-hand, and still others are excellent escape artists. Understanding what your organization's position of strength is with regards to your target market will allow you to focus resources on building it.</b></li> 
</ul> 
<ul> 
 <li><b>Get the mechanics right.</b> Magicians practice their tricks repeatedly until they become second nature. And feedback regarding if it was successful is pretty clear--people either like it or they don't.</li> 
</ul> 
<blockquote>
 <p><i><b>There used to be a hangout spot</b>, a deli, in New York. And in the back room, all of the top magicians would come and meet, and every young magician would go and try to learn something. I met a magician there... and he showed me an incredible card move, and as he was about to leave, I stopped him and said, ""Please show me how to do this."" He was like, ""Kid, don't waste your time—you'll never get this."" But before he left, he showed me how to do it, and for the next six months—every day—I practiced it.</i></p>
</blockquote> 
<blockquote>
 <p><i>Kalush, who's one of my best friends now, taught me that even when it feels like you're not going to succeed and everything is crumbling apart: <b>keep going.</b> <a href=""https://mentoring.esquire.com/david-blaine-726330754.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">David Blaine, Magician</a></i></p>
</blockquote> 
<ul>
 Organizations and its members need to take this to heart. Get the mechanics (of resolving customer complaints, of managing orders, or whatever customer related process you're responsible for) right. Only then do you incorporate the magic.
</ul> 
<ul> 
 <li><b>Understand your audience and focus on their needs.</b> Some people want to be treated special. They want you to know their name and how they like their coffee. Others just want fast, efficient service, particularly when returning or exchanging an item. This requires that an employee be able to quickly and successfully interpret and respond to a customer's needs. It's that understanding that makes or breaks the experience.</li> 
</ul> 
<ul> 
 <ul>
  That deficiency is part of the reason why many people hate dealing with call center representatives. Many reps are trained to work from a script and may have little flexibility in deviating from it. Lack of flexibility can make it difficult to satisfy the customer, especially if presented with an unusual situation. This is part of the reason that Zappos get high marks for their customer service. Their representatives don't use scripts. In addition, they're empowered to resolve most customer issues
 </ul> 
</ul> 
<p><i>without</i></p> 
<ul>
 management approval.
</ul> 
<ul> 
 <li><b>Give them something worthwhile. </b>Magical customer service goes beyond the transaction. Delighting your customers isn't a simple equation (efficient service + being nice = magical customer service). If you are a hack no amount of effort can make the audience (or customer) love you. 'Nuff said.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Ignorance isn't just bliss, sometimes it's magical. However, in an increasingly transparent world, customers and clients are less ignorant. Be prepared to deliver on these changing expectations by understanding your organization's strengths, getting the basics right, understanding your customer's needs, and being able to give them something worthwhile. Then you should be able to consistently create memorable magic.</p>

<!--more--><p>In our schools, for example, we have acclimated to testing utilizing a variety of methodologies and techniques.&nbsp; If someone is a poor traditional test-taker, then we have allowed them to verbally take the test with the teacher or demonstrate a mastery of the subject matter is other ways.&nbsp; Now move that same student ahead 10 years into the workforce.&nbsp; How many different ways are there for the worker to demonstrate his/her mastery of the subject (work)?&nbsp; Most times, there’s just one.&nbsp; We assess in specific, often singular, ways.&nbsp; A product has to look and function in a certain way; even the service industry has parameters to stay within.</p> 
<p>The point is not necessarily that we assess in various ways (though I would lean towards such a thought), but rather our workers are left outside of the process.&nbsp; They then slip into a fight or flight mentality.&nbsp; Turnover comes easier when I realize I can’t do the work the way you want.&nbsp; I will leave, no problem.&nbsp; If I am 24, I will find another entry level role.&nbsp; I’m young.&nbsp; No big deal.&nbsp; If I am 44, I will find another role.&nbsp; I’m still young enough (please don’t tell me that this is not still young…I might just breakdown).&nbsp; No big deal.&nbsp; Plus there is always unemployment insurance to assist me in the transition.</p> 
<p>But, if I choose to fight, I will retreat to entitlement.&nbsp; I will call upon the god of entitlement and its minions - accommodation, leave and disparate treatment.&nbsp; How can I take care of me?&nbsp; How has this work environment been unhealthy?&nbsp; It cannot be that I am unable to do what’s required of me, but rather it must be how terrible it is here at work.</p> 
<p>Sound familiar.&nbsp; Let me hit that nerve even more.&nbsp; How many businesses are living in fear of their employees?&nbsp; What if they sue?&nbsp; Complain?&nbsp; Gulp…call the Department of Labor?&nbsp; The organizations established to protect the American worker are viewed as the enemy of American business.&nbsp; How did this happen?&nbsp; Entitlement. &nbsp;(There are real situations where a breaking of the law is happening in some companies; it has to be addressed. &nbsp;Of course it does. &nbsp;I am not swinging the pendulum too far the other way.)</p> 
<p>So, what to do?</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Address it – don’t be scared!&nbsp; Call it out.&nbsp; Say, “We all come from a position of entitlement.”&nbsp; Work through simple examples.&nbsp; Don’t accuse.&nbsp; Share general observations.&nbsp; Let people laugh at you.&nbsp; Let them laugh at themselves.</li> 
 <li>Be transparent – as best as you can, share financials.&nbsp; Let people know that the pot is only so big.&nbsp; Yeah, I want to live at Google offices, too, but we can’t.&nbsp; Who’s going to pay for it?&nbsp; Once some more liquidity is in our hands, how should we spend it?&nbsp; Which of these three options makes better sense in light of our financials and our mission?&nbsp; Let employees engage!</li> 
 <li>Coach – devise a plan to battle “me first.”&nbsp; How do we call it out in each other without irritating the stew out of each other?&nbsp; There is nothing wrong with asking a question about self, but is that the default position?&nbsp; Demonstrate business acumen and meet your employee where he/she is.&nbsp; Guide them through components of business decisions.&nbsp; Long term, this will pay off in huge dividends…and I don’t mean just money.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>I believe we are better than entitlement.&nbsp; We have to be.&nbsp; Our business cultures, our family units, society as a whole needs us to move beyond this perspective.&nbsp; When we see it, we have to take action.&nbsp; Healthy, lasting business development comes out of a functional belief in the work to be done and the integrity it takes to do it.&nbsp; Encourage pride, speak to the struggles and affirm correct competencies. &nbsp;We are more than one.</p>

<!--more--><p>It's often the case that the simplest of stories can turn a head back to true north. &nbsp;Our gauge can be put off from purpose and passions because of the myriad of distractions in front of us. &nbsp;Our perspective has to be re-adjusted. &nbsp;We need to wake up. &nbsp;Sometimes, a trip to the woods is exactly what is needed.<br> Whether for a business or for an individual, this journey is one to be taken every so often. &nbsp;What can the challenges that come with walking through a different set of scenery do for you? &nbsp;Think about your company. &nbsp;What if you had three people walk in, at times you didn't know, when you were not there, and then report back what they observed. &nbsp;Would there be value in that? &nbsp;Of course! &nbsp;The meadow that you think you're lunching in may turn out to be full of thorns (or at least have some thorny patches).</p> 
<p>Perhaps it is wise to walk into a competitor's location and observe. &nbsp;You know, shop or use their services, but really just be there to take it all in. &nbsp;Sound deceptive? &nbsp;Nah. &nbsp;The great car makers bought cars from competitors. &nbsp;Mr. Gimbel shopped in Macy's once in a while. &nbsp;It's good. &nbsp;It's profitable.</p> 
<p>As individuals, the same push is there for us. &nbsp;Are we walking in the woods? &nbsp;Have I settled for complacency? &nbsp;Another line from <u>Into the Woods</u> is ""you're not good, you're not bad, you're just nice."" &nbsp;How awful! &nbsp;Listen, I think I am a pretty good guy, but I would rather have someone hate me than just think I am nice...bleck!</p> 
<p>With a new year upon us, what will you do to travel the path towards a new view, a new status, a new scene? &nbsp;I could give you a hundred ideas, but the point is to start the journey. &nbsp;Those doors will open. &nbsp;The pathway will become clearer. &nbsp;You will run into wolves, witches, princes and giants. &nbsp;All of them will help you to see who you are and who you want to strive to be. &nbsp;The inspiration comes not only from those feel-good moments, but also from those moments of despair and tragedy.</p> 
<p>Businesses must be sharp and ready. &nbsp;People must be challenged and pushed. &nbsp;We have each other. &nbsp;Walk the path with someone. &nbsp;Don't fear. &nbsp;Go to the woods!<br> </p>

Whatever money I had I would spend at the comic book shop, buying a variety of titles. And I come by it honestly--my mother enjoyed them as well. She would tell me about how when she was young, her mother made her throw out her collection. She had great titles, such as The Hulk, Fantastic Four, and others, that are now worth loads of money. I was horrified by my grandmother's treatment of these treasures. As a result I've done my best to preserve many of the comics I've purchased over the years.</p>
<!--more--><p>Eventually, my interest in purchasing comic books waned. There was a variety of reasons for it. For one, as I got older other interests took over. For another, I got jaded as the comic book market became more focused on driving sales over quality storytelling. Lastly, as any geek will tell you, the social pull to put aside ""childish"" pursuits got to be too much. But, remembering my mother's horror stories of potentially valuable art disposed of, I put my comics in storage.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the present and the success of Marvel and DC comics across a variety of entertainment mediums has reawakened my love of comic books. Over the past several weeks I've gone into my storage space and gathered a few titles to read, as well as share with my kids.</p>
<p>Having them out has done a few things for me. It's sparked curiosity and creativity, not only in my kids but within me as well. We've had great discussions on character motivation, morality in comics, as well as different ways in which artists interpret certain iconic characters. This has prompted them, along with myself, to create our own comic inspired art.</p>
<p>As a Human Resources Consultant, revisiting my comic book collection has helped me to draw connections between art and work.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>HR and its perception as the villain.</strong> HR practitioners are often viewed as the ""bad guys"" within organizations. And some of us (unfortunately) are deserving of the label! Oftentimes, like the X-Men, we're just misunderstood.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Villains and ethical behavior. </strong>Continuing with villains... great heroes are defined by the enemies they face. Batman vs. Joker. Captain America vs. the Red Skull. Many of the most well known heroes faced tremendous adversity. Most of the time they've been able to outwit their opponents. The critical difference is that the hero finds a way to succeed without sacrificing their morals<strong>.</strong> While it might be easy to view a disliked colleague as your enemy it's disruptive to business if you deal with them in an unethical manner. Remember, ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Ben#.22With_great_power_comes_great_responsibility.22"" target=""_blank"" shape=""rect"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">with great power comes great responsibility</a>"".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>To be successful it helps to have an ego.</strong> Think about it--why would anyone run around in tights? On a more realistic level, think about some of your career goals and what it'll take to achieve them. Whether it's to bring criminals to justice or getting promoted, achieving your objectives sometimes means ignoring what others may think of you (and your wardrobe choices). It means believing in yourself and your abilities, especially when it seems you're the only one that does.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Teamwork. </strong>Even singular legends, such as Superman, Batman, and the Hulk, can't always solve issues alone. All are actively part of, or have partnered with, groups through which they've tackled problems beyond their capabilities. For us normal folks, think about which organizations or groups you're a part of (or should be). Can they help get you to the next level? Will its members challenge and encourage your unique combination of abilities?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Persistence.</strong> Comic books were considered cheap entertainment (literally and figuratively) when they were first introduced. Now they constitute multi-billion dollar properties. Doggedly pursuing your goals even when the general public may not appreciate your work is a great characteristic to possess.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Diversity and the lack thereof. </strong>There are no shortage of comic book characters. Look beneath the surface and you may notice that they tend to look alike. Quick-name three superheroes of color? That are gay? And there's much to be said about its portrayal of female characters. Unfortunately, comics mirror society in this respect. While the situation is improving (for example, with the launch of the Black Panther movie, as well as the introduction of the Falcon character in Captain America: The Winter Soldier), there's still a lot of work to be done.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Comics have been more than cheap entertainment for me. It's served as a creative metaphor for my work as a Human Resources practitioner, and how to be successful as one.</p>
<p>What's inspired you to be great at what you do?</p>

<!--more--><p>And yet, it didn’t happen.&nbsp; We talked.&nbsp; We realized that we weren’t where we thought we were.&nbsp; It was awful.&nbsp; I felt a bit like Lloyd Dobler – “I gave her my heart and she gave me a pen.”&nbsp; Moving on was the right call, however.&nbsp; Last I heard she was married.&nbsp; Me, too.&nbsp; Good for her.</p> 
<p>Moving on is a difficult decision.&nbsp; As business professionals, how do we determine if it’s time to move on?&nbsp; I don’t mean just for ourselves, but for those on our teams, too.&nbsp; For some employees it is easy to see.&nbsp; Obnoxious behavior mixed with poor work performance.&nbsp; SEE YA!&nbsp; It is a simple conversation.&nbsp; For others, it might be a matter of observation of their buy-in, their spirit, their passion.&nbsp; Has all of that waned?&nbsp; Is it being forced?&nbsp; Are the conversations less fun, only business?&nbsp; The work might be getting done, but the heart is no longer connected?&nbsp; Tough call, right?</p> 
<p>Surely, the first measure is to have an honest conversation with that person.&nbsp; Ask good questions about satisfaction, purpose, connection, environment.&nbsp; Draw out perspective and emotion.&nbsp; Many of our teammates want to be asked.&nbsp; The first couple of minutes may be awkward but plow through it.&nbsp; The fruit of such conversations can alter the fabric of the company.&nbsp; And sometimes, a trip to Mood is warranted (yes, I watch Project Runway, so?).</p> 
<p>However, let’s say that these conversations illicit none of the magic hoped for.&nbsp; What then?&nbsp; Go back to the job description.&nbsp; Is the person doing what he/she is to do?&nbsp; Does the job description accurately reflect the KSA’s needed?&nbsp; If collaboration, for example, is needed to do the work and it is not on the JD, then update it.&nbsp; This will allow for truer dialogue around the duties rather than just a sense of disconnect.&nbsp; Be mindful, though, to not make the JD too person-specific.&nbsp; If Joe usually makes the coffee for the office in the morning and he stops doing so, and you sense something is wrong, I wouldn’t change his JD to include coffee preparation (unless he is a Barista).&nbsp; Look only at the core duties for the role and what is needed to perform it well.</p> 
<p>Sometimes, people need a conversation to cause them to “wake up” and look at how off track they’ve gotten.&nbsp; Sometimes, they need a more formal interaction to do that.&nbsp; And sometimes, it might lead to a new season for that person and for the company.&nbsp; Sometimes it’s very healthy for someone to move on, even if they’ve been a decent employee for a while.&nbsp; Maybe they’ve hit a ceiling and the challenges are few and far between.&nbsp; Maybe they are at the max for compensation and that takes them down a peg or two.&nbsp; Maybe they’ve just grown apart from the role.&nbsp; It happens.</p> 
<p>A word to my HR peeps…this applies to you, too.&nbsp; Some of you need to leave where you are working.&nbsp; Rough, right?&nbsp; But I am serious.&nbsp; You’re too settled, too cranky, too blasé, too distant.&nbsp; Do a self-check, but also ask for feedback from those who know and work with you.&nbsp; Staying with a job because you make good money is not helping the company.&nbsp; Our role is to encourage health and growth within the organizations we serve.&nbsp; If what we’re modeling is more of a “put my time in” kind of attitude, then we shoot ourselves in the foot.&nbsp; Trust that your skill sets and aptitudes will open doors elsewhere for you; they can take you to a new challenge where passion and joy return.&nbsp; Love your company enough to go.</p> 
<p>And if you're not ready to go yet, then use the self-assessment and feedback from others to put you back on track. &nbsp;Raise high the boom box and fight back!</p> 
<p>One of my great loves in business is the “fire in your belly” that can grow.&nbsp; Time does not have to dampen this.&nbsp; Just because an HR pro or a CEO has been with one company for ten years does not establish some milestone that it’s time to go.&nbsp; There is a difference between time spent and time served.&nbsp; Follow?</p> 
<p>Seasons change.&nbsp; There is no question.&nbsp; I am not in the same role I was in 20 years ago.&nbsp; I am not in the same role I was in 3 years ago.&nbsp; And I am not married to the person I almost married 20 years ago.&nbsp; As painful and scary as those seasons might be, they do change.</p>

<!--more--><p>What stands out to me is that I was not invited by my high school to be considered for RYLA.&nbsp; For whatever reasons, the Guidance Department did not initially invite me to interview with local Rotary members for the opportunity to attend.&nbsp; There were to be only four students selected for consideration – two guys and two ladies.&nbsp; When I saw my friends get invites to miss a class in order to interview, I walked out of class and went to the guidance office.&nbsp; A couple of my friends ran out after me and told me not to worry about it.&nbsp; They asked me what the big deal was.&nbsp; The rejection, the lack of ask, made me want to do something to change the perception that was obviously there.</p> 
<p>As you might imagine, I was mad.&nbsp; So, I shared with the Director of Guidance my feelings about the circumstances.&nbsp; She apologized and said they had decided to exclude me because they thought I wouldn’t be interested.&nbsp; What?&nbsp; A free vacation without my parents and you thought I wouldn’t be interested?&nbsp; What about me says “not interested”?&nbsp; That conversation took longer, but needless to say, I secured an interview slot and kicked butt in the interview.</p> 
<p>Assumption is an interesting reality for management.&nbsp; I have heard on many occasions, “Oh, Joe (insert your own name of choice) would never agree to that.&nbsp; He won’t do that work.&nbsp; He isn’t interested in projects.&nbsp; He doesn’t like the company so he wouldn’t do it.”&nbsp; The reasons might be one or many, but managers use their observations to determine a response from a staff member without ever asking the employee.&nbsp; Not only was the Guidance Department sure I wouldn’t be interested, but they about fell over when the Selection Committee chose me as one of the finalists.</p> 
<p>Those with authority in your organization might only see glimmers of a person’s responsiveness or work output.&nbsp; From a distance, it might seem to say something to them.&nbsp; Those who are on the ground more might have a different perspective. &nbsp;To be sure, there is something quite rich about opening a door for consideration with the individual employee directly.</p> 
<p>Simply asking the employee whether he/she is interested in working on this extra project or handling a particular situation has great merit.&nbsp; The response from the employee might surprise you.&nbsp; The employee himself/herself might be surprised that you would think to ask.&nbsp; As a result, work performance could increase or mature.&nbsp; Understanding that the “company” is watching him/her should motivate, or at least, shock him/her back into right work habits.&nbsp; The value comes in the results of asking.</p> 
<p>If I had not been selected for the RYLA opportunity, I would have been disappointed; however, my disappointment in my high school leadership was greater.&nbsp; Winning allowed me to shove it in their faces, but it did not remove the fact that they didn’t think it was for me.&nbsp; What was I showing them?&nbsp; What about me categorized me as a “just get by” kind of kid?&nbsp; I had excelled in so much, well, at least in my mind.&nbsp; The lack of the “ask” opened my eyes to see that my perspective on others’ view of me was flawed.</p> 
<p>Ask your team to step up.&nbsp; Ask them to engage in special projects.&nbsp; Ask them to lead a team to accomplish a certain production goal.&nbsp; Ask them to train others.&nbsp; Do it clearly and consistently.&nbsp; Avoid assumptions.&nbsp; When someone turns you down, then your view is based on fact rather than an assumption.&nbsp; Allow an employee to own his/her future.&nbsp; Declining opportunities to lead, to grow, to engage by an employee allows you to determine long-term involvement by that employee.&nbsp; You can then move on to cultivate those that really want to immerse themselves in service to the organization.</p> 
<p>The “ask” has great value.&nbsp; Be willing to ask people to engage.&nbsp; There is nothing wrong with doing so.&nbsp; Just do not assume the answer first.&nbsp; Let the adult employee answer for himself/herself.&nbsp; Actions taken as a result of the answer then have context.</p>

<p>I'm enjoying it. This camera is a big leap forward from snapping pictures using my phone. It's also more sophisticated than any camera I ever had. While fairly simple to use, the options available (to control and manipulate various settings, for example), make it an item that will test my abilities, in addition to my patience. It makes me excited and nervous to own. My wife points out that I need to ""grow into it."" How do I do that? Learning how to use this camera reminds me of a number of job roles I've taken on throughout my career as a Human Resources professional. Some were newly created, others were such where I replaced a previous HR practitioner with the understanding that I revamp or enhance the function. In all cases I started as someone who needed to ""grow into"" the role. I had to quickly assess the function's strengths and weaknesses, as well as its allies and resources. I was important to gain a clear understanding of priorities--what institutional ""fires"" that needed to be put out, what goals needed to be met, and when--so that I could organize my time and energy as effectively as possible. At its core, to fully embrace the challenge of being in a new and unfamiliar position I had to be willing to commit to doing the work necessary, to literally and figuratively rolling up my sleeves. Without that it would have been easy to become overwhelmed. Here are a few more tips on how a person can grow into a job role:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li><b>Humble yourself. </b>Be realistic about your capabilities, commitment levels, and your goals. Come to terms with the idea that you will fall on your ass. Going back to my recently purchased camera, I'm doing my best not to get flustered when I take a bad shot (and I've been taking plenty of them!). I use them as examples of what's not working, and I adjust.</li>

</table> 
<div></div> 
<ul> 
 <li><b>Take note of your successes and failures.</b> With my camera, I've been taking notes of the different settings I've tried, paying attention to which ones are resulting in good photos. In my professional work, I purchase a notebook whenever I start a new role or work with a client. I write everything in it, allowing me a place to store (in one place) all relevant information and thoughts. Not only does this method help me to stay organized, it allows me to note progress over time. This is important, because it helps to provide perspective, particularly when you (or clients) may believe that adequate progress isn't being made.</li> 
 <li><b>Pace yourself. </b>The temptation to work long hours in order to get acclimated to your new role is not uncommon. Be careful; something that was expected to be a temporary solution (working extra hours, taking work home, etc.) can turn into the norm if you're not mindful. My advice--create an action plan, one that factors in when and how long you may need to put in extra time and effort in order to accomplish a particular goal.</li> 
 <li><b>Use your resources</b>--digital, human, and other--to figure out how to get the most out of the role. To better learn how to use my DSLR camera, I'm turning to a variety of resources, which includes: 
  <ul> 
   <li>YouTube</li> 
   <li>Friends</li> 
   <li>Family</li> 
   <li>Classes (e.g., YMCA)</li> 
   <li>Pinterest</li> 
   <li>Discussion forums</li> 
   <li>the camera's User's Manual</li> 
  </ul> </li> 
</ul> 
<ul>
 This can be applied to learning a new job role, also. From a workplace point of view, you have colleagues, subject matter experts (SMEs), and groups (such as professional associations) which represent sources of information and support. Use them--that's what they're there for!
 <p></p> 
 <li><b>Celebrate your successes. </b>In spite your best efforts, it may seem as if progress isn't being made. Perhaps you're not making headway on a particular project. Or colleagues are frustrating. Whatever the case, when something does go right, acknowledge it! Sometimes it's the small wins that help to highlight progress, or that your work is having an impact. When it comes to my new camera, when I take a decent picture utilizing the manual settings, I get very excited!</li> 
</ul>

<p>At one point or another, a person is faced with a job that they will seem new, unfamiliar, or bigger than they've previously encountered. Understanding the challenges and opportunities in that scenario will help increase the odds of success in that role. Humble yourself, be organized, pace yourself, use your resources, and celebrate success--these are some ways in which to grow into a job role.</p>

<!--more--><p>It’s no fun, but it happens.&nbsp; Besides the knee-jerk reaction, there are important questions that should be asked:</p> 
<p>1 – <strong>What led up to this person’s departure?</strong> – There were warning signs, even subtle ones.&nbsp; Longer lunches to perhaps squeeze in an interview?&nbsp; Wearing nicer ensembles to work? A definite change to communication patterns?&nbsp; Less willingness to do that little bit extra?&nbsp; Think back.</p> 
<p>While reflection may not change the outcome, it is important to become better at identifying the signs for the future.&nbsp; Being oblivious is not okay when it comes to talent management.&nbsp; In the full picture, it’s critical to manage your talent effectively, which includes observation and action.&nbsp; Asking yourself, “What should I have done?” is fine, but asking, “What can I do now?” is better.</p> 
<p>2 – <strong>How effective has support and accountability been?</strong> – Odd question, perhaps.&nbsp; Truthfully, it’s often the case that someone leaves because he/she feels like so much work and effort has been done by him/her without reciprocity from other team members.&nbsp; Accountability keeps everyone honest.&nbsp; It also keeps dialogue going regarding areas of drop-off.&nbsp; Support and re-structure can be offered once those details are known.</p> 
<p>3 – <strong>How will we get the knowledge about processes, systems, compliance, etc. out of his/her head and into someone else’s in the organization? </strong>– I often joke with a new employee when introducing him/her to a seasoned veteran of the company that the veteran has probably forgotten more than the new employee will ever know.&nbsp; There is truth to this, though.&nbsp; If someone has been with the organization for years and is truly a key employee (not just dead weight that has been allowed to fester for decades because no one is brave enough to do something about it…ouch!), then the knowledge along with the nuances of history are hard to replace.</p> 
<p>Effort needs to be put into mentoring and coaching opportunities regularly.&nbsp; To try to get all of the knowledge out of someone’s head who just gave his/her two weeks’ notice is silly.&nbsp; It won’t happen.&nbsp; By establishing it as a normal business practice avoids panic and an unreasonable&nbsp; burden of “data dump” between the leaving and the staying employees.</p> 
<p>4 – <strong>Is the position needed?</strong> – Nothing says “Don’t let the door hit you….” then when you realize you haven’t needed that role for some time and have no intentions of filling that role.&nbsp; But it’s true!&nbsp; Out of our busyness or sheer laziness, we haven’t looked at role effectiveness.&nbsp; Perhaps a resignation is a gift (for a variety of reasons, I know) in this vein because we can be forced to look at structure and process.&nbsp; Does this role push the mission for the organization?&nbsp; Is there overkill in the management level of the org chart?&nbsp; Or, the real kicker, measure the results of that position.&nbsp; If it’s not acceptable, was that because of the person in the role? Or because you don’t need the role?</p> 
<p>5 – <strong>What will the ripple effect be, if any?</strong> – “Who’s with me?” For those of you who’ve not seen the movie “Gung Ho,” watch it.&nbsp; Besides the datedness and the stereotypes, it deals with productivity and cultural issues.&nbsp; A rallying of the troops as a result of someone leaving can be crushing, of course.&nbsp; Walk outs or just a couple more resignations can affect morale deeply.&nbsp; Repair won’t be overnight.</p> 
<p>Proactively engaging a couple of layers of managers and directors will thwart one person from having such power.&nbsp; Even if a key employee leaves, the communication channels would have been open to more than merely that supervisor.&nbsp; If I can approach my manager, my director, my CEO as well as my team, then the departure of that manager won’t seem as “end of the world” as if he/she was the only superior who knew I existed.&nbsp; Be visible, be communicative, be real.</p> 
<p>Overall, it’s wise to care for all employees.&nbsp; It’s very wise to care for those key employees.&nbsp; Know what they need.&nbsp; Know why they need it.&nbsp; Know how support can be given.&nbsp; BUT, measure effectiveness, too.&nbsp; We’re not prisoners.&nbsp; We don’t have to be held hostage by a key employee.&nbsp; Figure out why and how to get the information out of his/her head and into others’ heads.</p> 
<p>And to be truthful, a healthy resignation can do wonders for a company, too.&nbsp; Jus’ sayin’.</p>","https://21594889.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21594889/Imported_Blog_Media/Got-til-Its-Gone.jpg","","PUBLISHED","false"

<!--more--><p>We spend millions trying to find it or create it.&nbsp; We reinvent wheels.&nbsp; We look to find secrets &nbsp;that will help to shorten the time it takes to achieve it.&nbsp; We look for quick results.&nbsp; We want to have an impact that will generate revenue.</p> 
<p>Having been able to sit with many CEO’s over my years, I have heard variations on the pursuit of success, but all of it basically boiling down to these points.&nbsp; And what I have often considered is that success is like dieting or getting into shape.</p> 
<p>We buy the latest series for weight loss.&nbsp; We join gyms.&nbsp; We get up before the crack of dawn to do boot camp in the park.&nbsp; We bike, hike, take pills and drink shakes.&nbsp; We’ve worn leg warmers with Jane Fonda, sweat to the oldies with Richard Simmons, Tae Bo’d with Billy Blanks, Pilate’d, P90X’d, Insanity’d.&nbsp; We cleanse, eat organic, say no to carbs, say no to fats, say no to dairy, say no to red meat.&nbsp; The exercise, fitness and diet industries are multi-billion dollar industries.</p> 
<p>And yet, in the US, we are the most obese population ever.&nbsp; Curious.</p> 
<p>Success seems to be the same.&nbsp; We commit to so much to make our companies excel.&nbsp; We hire consultants, fire consultants, post new mission statements, develop incentive-based compensation plans.&nbsp; I am not saying this is all for naught.&nbsp; I will be the first one to tout the values of knowing where you want to get to and leading that team with conviction.</p> 
<p>What we ought not to do is join the fitness program at Exhale Spa, buy a new outfit from LuluLemon, workout for a week or two, get tired of it, make excuses, grow fat, be disappointed in our efforts (or lack thereof) and then look for the next quick fix.&nbsp; Success is built on the pain of consistency and failure.</p> 
<p>Our capabilities are real.&nbsp; We should encourage the greatness that lies within each of us; the full effect of that will be realized within an organization.&nbsp; These are not mere words, but rather a call to action.&nbsp; As leaders we must engage a concept of success that is realistic.&nbsp; Set the foundation with mission and vision, lay framework with expectations and accountability, add components of structure with trial, collaboration, skills and communication.&nbsp; These components are refined over time.</p> 
<p>Success is rarely overnight.&nbsp; Success is not a destination but a journey.&nbsp; Once success is “achieved,” you have to start at it again tomorrow.&nbsp; Every day, you gotta be ready for what the call to success asks for – consistency, excellence, commitment and sweat!</p>","https://21594889.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21594889/Imported_Blog_Media/You-Gotta-Be.jpg","","PUBLISHED","false"

<!--more--><p>In human resources, I have experienced and witnessed a similar phenomenon.&nbsp; While the distractions may differ, the results are the same.&nbsp; For example, think about how much time you spend at your desk. &nbsp;Can’t do it?&nbsp; How about for the next 7 days, you keep a log (seriously!) as to how much time you are sitting at your desk.&nbsp; Now, while sitting at your desk is not the enemy, per se, it may show you how much less you’re actually amongst the people you serve.</p> 
<p>And it isn’t just about paperwork either.&nbsp; I bet it would be amazing for you to log how long you actually spend with a particular person or two each week.&nbsp; Perhaps it’s all good stuff, but likely, you may have your time taxed by someone that should not have as much time as he/she has been allowed to have.&nbsp; Think about that employee who “just needs 5 minutes” each day.&nbsp; We know that 5 becomes 20 in seconds.&nbsp; If it’s every day, what could you do with an extra hour and 40 minutes each week?</p> 
<p>There are still those time-suckers who want to review something again, complain about something again, have software explained to them again…it’s the same stuff time after time.&nbsp; Am I insane?&nbsp; Do I expect a different outcome?&nbsp; Why do I allow this distraction to take me away from serving the larger population?&nbsp; Stop the madness…you cannot get that time back.&nbsp; Make decisions about the wasting of time.&nbsp; If someone cannot handle the work they’ve been given, then get them out of that role.&nbsp; If the same process isn’t getting the results needed, then put the effort in to change the process so you can be free from the hamster wheel.&nbsp; Make the change.</p> 
<p>I am not making light of responsibilities.&nbsp; I know that form completion matters.&nbsp; I know that one-on-one chats have to happen.&nbsp; I know that your CEO will walk into your office and eat an hour of time.&nbsp; I know.&nbsp; Is that every day?&nbsp; Is it keeping you from the objectives you’ve set?</p> 
<p>Time will keep moving on.&nbsp; Those goals you have for 2014 have a smaller window for completion.&nbsp; We’re about 9.5 months into the year.&nbsp; Can you accomplish those goals you set for the people of your organization in these last couple of months?&nbsp; If so, maybe those goals weren’t so stretching after all?</p> 
<p>Are you allowing busyness and distraction to keep you from what you’re to do?&nbsp; My words are easy to type.&nbsp; The action of leaving your office for a time and closing the door behind you might be a discipline that you have to employ.&nbsp; Be with the people.&nbsp; Learn processes.&nbsp; Watch cultural interaction.&nbsp; Those components will make you a better HR person, a better business partner, a better worker.&nbsp; You will be energized, enlightened…more alive!&nbsp; Take back your time.</p>

<!--more--><p>I've worked many jobs in my career. Some I've enjoyed, others I've hated. I'm fortunate at this stage of my life to be involved in a few professional ventures that I really enjoy.</p> 
<p>Part of why I'm in a good place these days is that I've found a way to incorporate my creative talents into my work. For example, I've been writing for over five years for various blogs and other outlets. This has provided me with opportunities for my work to appear in magazines, to travel, as well as connect with other great professionals. My emerging interest in photography and graphic design is helping me with my clients and their respective needs. My hobbies and interests have a home in my places of work.</p> 
<p>My creative activities also serve as a diary of sorts. It gives me an opportunity to reflect on my growth and development, both as a HR practitioner as well as a person.</p> 
<p>I say all this because I recently read a NPR article entitled, '<a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2014/04/17/303769531/could-those-weekend-pottery-classes-help-you-get-promoted-at-work"">Got A Hobby? Might Be A Smart Professional Move.</a>' In it, the author, Maanvi Singh, discusses research which reveals that employees who have creative endeavors outside of work tend to perform better at work.</p> 
<p>According to the researchers <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/joop.12064/abstract"">abstract</a>: <i></i></p> 
<blockquote>
 <p><i>We conducted two studies that examined the relationships between non-work creative activity, recovery experiences, and performance-related behaviours at work. Creative activity was positively associated with recovery experiences (i.e., mastery, control, and relaxation) and performance-related outcomes (i.e., job creativity and extra-role behaviours).</i></p>
</blockquote> 
<p>A word of caution--it was a study done on a small group of professionals. Also, more research needs to be done on the connection between a person's creative outlet and work performance. Therefore, I wouldn't point to it as definitive proof of a relationship.</p> 
<p>For me, however, it does make sense. Particularly as a consultant, I'm more engaged with clients when I can bring my full array of talents to work, even if they're not needed or utilized. And I've learned plenty of things at work that I've applied at home. Also, having a creative outlet helps me to relieve stress and to regain balance.</p> 
<p>How can employees figure out how to be more creative at work, so that they can be more satisfied? Here are a few suggestions:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li><b>Look at yourself.</b> Take stock of the things you like to do, particularly those activities that you may not be able to engage in during work hours. Perhaps you like art, or exercising. Whatever it is, take stock of those things.</li> 
 <li><b>Look at your job.</b> What type of organization do you work for? Specifically, what are the values and expectations within it? Understanding the type of environment you work within can help you identify whether or not there's an opportunity to explore incorporating creative activities at work. For example, I've worked in environments where my social media activities were encouraged. In others, it was a big no-no.</li> 
 <li><b>Look at your supervisor.</b> You will have no bigger advocate or obstacle than your immediate supervisor. And that goes for any organizational initiative you may want to implement or adjust.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Finding that professional/personal sweet spot is tough, whether you're a CEO or the janitor. When people are able to clearly articulate and exist within that sweet spot between the two, they (in my opinion) tend to do better at work.<br> </p>

 <li>How did it get this way?&nbsp; What has to change?</li> 
 <li>What are the expectations for the company as described by the Executive team?</li> 
 <li>Who should be handling certain components of the process?&nbsp; When can I sit with them to review?</li> 
</ul> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Post-Process:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>What elements were accomplished?&nbsp; What’s working well?</li> 
 <li>Where are there still missing pieces? Who is addressing those needs?&nbsp; How?</li> 
 <li>Who is/was unable to handle the responsibilities given?&nbsp; Time for change?</li> 
</ul> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>These questions can be drilled down more, but the general idea is to challenge yourself to answer them.&nbsp; Sit down ahead of time with the pre-process list of questions and write down answers.&nbsp; When we answer them in our heads only, it’s often the case that’s where they’ll stay.&nbsp; Write the answers; from these answers, an action plan is created.&nbsp; This is not an exercise in accountability only, but also in planning with purpose.</p> 
<p>Our companies are in need of dynamic resources to handle the mandate of “more with less.”&nbsp; I don’t see this trend changing anytime soon.&nbsp; The fear of finances around tax increases, ACA compliance and global military activity is real and impacts markets.</p> 
<p>Listen, for those of you still holding onto hope that you’ll be allowed to fill that job requisition for additional help in your department…let it go.&nbsp; Don’t depend on it.&nbsp; It’s been two years.&nbsp; The company is not bringing on another HR Generalist for you.&nbsp; Be creative, be industrious, but don’t be stupid.&nbsp; If the answer is that next quarter might look better and we’ll see then, give it up.&nbsp; Work with what you have; just work it stronger and with real expectations.&nbsp; I have had the opportunity to sit with HR departments who regale me with the plans they have for an additional person they’ll eventually be allowed to have.&nbsp; In the meantime, though, that list of work and plans sits dormant waiting for that person.&nbsp; Why?</p> 
<p>Meet with the executive team to determine the fiscal expectations of the company for the next 6 months.&nbsp; Then take that understanding and create the process list for pre-, during and post-.&nbsp; Assign roles, speak to the cultural leadership needed and provide timelines.&nbsp; Yes, hold people accountable, including yourself, but do it based upon a clearer understanding of the expectations of the company’s financial strategy.</p> 
<p>Oh yea, for those of you reading this who are saying, “no one on the executive team shares this with HR,” then figure out how to make them.&nbsp; Give them the business case for HR’s involvement.&nbsp; Show them what you know how to do.&nbsp; Let them see the resources you have ready to go once you know where you’re going.&nbsp; Of all people, HR seems to know how to do more with less.&nbsp; We’ve done it for decades.</p>","https://21594889.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21594889/Imported_Blog_Media/Everyday-I-Write-the-Book.jpg","","PUBLISHED","false"

<!--more--><p>Think for a minute about how we would do that in a Human Resources function.&nbsp; Are we to be the “boo boo” office?&nbsp; Regardless of how many HR departments that I’ve known that were (some still “are”) exclusively like this, I recognize that there really is no other place employees would think of going to than HR for such a need.&nbsp; So what do you do?</p> 
<p>To start, I think it would be kind of awkward to hug and kiss the forehead of an employee whose feelings were hurt by a rough manager.&nbsp; Aside from the lawsuit that might accompany it (think I’m kidding?), I would submit that there is a diminishing of HR when this is done.&nbsp; Employees might see our office as we did the Nurse’s Office in school – it was a way to get out of class for a bit and you could rest there.&nbsp; There was a guy I knew in school who went to the nurse’s office 3 days a week after lunch for a nap.&nbsp; He didn’t have a doctor’s note or a parent’s permission.&nbsp; There was just a sweet nurse who liked him and let him sleep.&nbsp; Are we merely a “nice nurse?”&nbsp; The nurse in school had her nursing degree and a skill set in it, but she relegated herself as being nice.&nbsp; Her competencies were not appreciated by those she served.</p> 
<p>Comforting a person in a tough situation or who is experiencing difficulty should have a human aspect to it.&nbsp; I am not advocating a cold HR office (far from it!).&nbsp; I believe that there is a deep reason to have an HR professional who can connect to the talent within an organization.&nbsp; As cultural ambassadors for our companies, we have to engage with our staff to win the right to be heard.&nbsp; We offer a productive viewpoint and a desire to affect change that is most readily received by an audience who knows us.</p> 
<p>When M'Lynn (Sally Field in ""Steel Magnolias"") loses her daughter Shelby (Julia Roberts), she is rallied to by all of the people in her life who really know her. &nbsp;And while I know that the gut-wrenching scene at the cemetery is not what most HR folks will deal with each day, I do know that the aspect of putting yourself out there has to be practiced in order to engage with others in an impactful way.</p> 
<p>By being real, we open a door.&nbsp; Are you hiding behind your door?&nbsp; Open it.&nbsp; Get up from your desk, open the door and head out to the assembly line, the sales floor or the customer service department.&nbsp; Your words will bring healing when they are heard in the context of your relational deposits and cultural encouragement.&nbsp; Believe that your skill set will shine as you embrace (figuratively) the staff you serve.</p> 
<p>And consider that as people grow and mature (well, most people do…I see your head shaking…I know some exceptions myself!), the way in which comfort and connection happen might have to evolve, too.&nbsp; I don’t speak to the entry-level folks exactly the way I do to those I’ve known for 20 years in the workforce.&nbsp; There is history between us that I draw upon and allow my conversation to reflect that depth.&nbsp; I won’t be able to just “kiss it and make it better” with them any longer.</p> 
<p>Today, as my kids get older, I think about how one day they will be comforting me as I age.&nbsp; When my ability to do things as I’ve always done becomes impaired, my children will have to use some of the skills in comforting that I’ve shown them.&nbsp; I trust that those deposits of family culture and engagement will blossom into confidence and leadership as they take ownership of the family.&nbsp; We need to build people up to handle such difficulties.&nbsp; Whether our kids or our employees, we can bring comfort.&nbsp; Think about the cultural deposits you’re making towards it.</p>

<!--more--><p>In what ways do we become what we need to in order for the message we need to share to propagate?&nbsp; I think about the tons of training I’ve done through the years and the ways in which I have had to grow the delivery and the content structure to meet the audiences in need of the knowledge.&nbsp; Wow.&nbsp; So many “performances.”</p> 
<p>Please know that I don’t use that word – performance – lightly or with frivolity.&nbsp; I mean, performance.&nbsp; The delivery of our information is as important as the information itself.&nbsp; If we are unaware of the learning styles, the history of training in the company or the expectation of knowledge applied in the company, then we’re likely to see training fail.&nbsp; That time will be little more than time off from the line for the average worker.</p> 
<p>Ultimately, we know that this is not the desire of training.&nbsp; The goal is usually wanting to expand upon some knowledge already in use and add to its functionality, or use it to build a bridge to another knowledge base.&nbsp; So many times, I have watched the connection light bulbs go off.&nbsp; These men and women, who have honed a craft, see the value in the information presented and desire to add it to the repertoire of duties they have.&nbsp; It’s humbling.</p> 
<p>And yet, I have also seen just the opposite.&nbsp; I don’t always hit it out of the park.&nbsp; I watch eyes that seem to say, “OK, how much longer do I have to sit here?”&nbsp; Ugh.&nbsp; That’s not such a great feeling.&nbsp; Our duty as trainers is to give connectivity and relevance which comes from knowing your audience and the material well.&nbsp; It then requires delivery in such a way as to hold attention, show appreciation and encourage participation.</p> 
<p>Even in matters of compliance information, how much thought do we put into delivery? &nbsp;With the Affordable Care Act, there is much to share, for example. &nbsp;The material itself can be confusing or overwhelming, so consideration should be given as to how to deliver it. &nbsp;For me, as I've shared with many on this topic, I have begun an information session by asking how the audience would have handled health insurance reform. &nbsp;Obviously, you've got to keep a tight reign on conversation, but it has allowed the hearers to understand some parallels to the ACA. &nbsp;Building blocks.</p> 
<p>Listen, constantly doing role play won’t work.&nbsp; Always doing a video isn’t going to do it.&nbsp; Arts and crafts at every training session is weird.&nbsp; Think about variety.&nbsp; Think about holding interest.&nbsp; Think about the goal of the information.&nbsp; Allow that to drive preparation for delivery.&nbsp; Study the material to know it inside and out, yes, but also figure out what the best delivery method would be.</p> 
<p>Think about how weird it might have been to sit in the creative arts and development office for a major television network and offer the Muppets as an adult solution to a primetime slot. &nbsp;Crazy! &nbsp;And yet, it worked because the delivery of material (the performance) was mindful of its audience. &nbsp;We stepped outside of ourselves and entered this world. &nbsp;That's what training should afford - setting the stage for dynamic engagement where effectual change occurs.</p>

<!--more--><p>I like this guy.&nbsp; I do.&nbsp; It’s not just because he feels the pain of some of the HR situations I find myself in.&nbsp; It’s not because I think all people suck (I don’t, really…no, really).&nbsp; I find him to be honest.&nbsp; His frustrations represent a belief that some of the systems put in place to protect people have now become crutches for some.&nbsp; I concur.&nbsp; He isn’t lying.</p> 
<p>What I have often said is that it’s about people not programs.&nbsp; It’s wonderfully smart to have sexual harassment seminars for your staff, but does it stop people from claiming that harassment has occurred?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; And why is that?&nbsp; Maybe it’s because it’s too easy to get a payout.&nbsp; Why go through all of the drama of court?&nbsp; Why spend all of that money and waste time when the results will probably be the same settlement anyway?&nbsp; It’s been the pattern for quite some time.</p> 
<p>I’d like to submit a thought.&nbsp; Culture.&nbsp; I recognize compliance.&nbsp; I recognize culpability.&nbsp; Culture, done well, trumps much.&nbsp; Fit matters more than need.&nbsp; Filling a need with the first available often does not work out.&nbsp; Waiting for someone who fits the culture is worth it in the long run.&nbsp; Too many times we fill to fill, to check it off the list.&nbsp; We did it…yay, us!&nbsp; Woo Hoo, Recruiting Team!&nbsp; (OK, too sarcastically HR…sorry).</p> 
<p>Patience, people.&nbsp; Let’s find us some good peeps!&nbsp; When people are set up for success in a culture that fits, then a multitude of problems never happen.&nbsp; I am not saying that harassment training is a waste.&nbsp; I am not saying that at all.&nbsp; What I am saying is that if you think annual sexual harassment training is going to keep it from happening or at least the complaint of it happening, then you’re out of your tree.&nbsp; Train to the positives daily.&nbsp; Handle the negatives as they come up.</p> 
<p>By creating a culture of health through challenging opportunities and open communication, then you’re more likely to see people flourish and not take the time to be entitled.&nbsp; We can’t fear the impact of the claim that might come up (anyone can sue for anything…welcome to America).&nbsp; Instead of being overwhelmed in frustration by it, we should use that energy to positively promote healthy dialogue and right thinking in relationships.</p> 
<p>Management should be encouraged greatly.&nbsp; As HR, we have a big responsibility with managers and ought to regularly seek to impact them.</p> 
<p>Do I think that things are better today in the working environment?&nbsp; Sure, but when compared to specific places in time.&nbsp; Do I think we operate in fear rather than proactivity?&nbsp; Yup.&nbsp; Our companies might see fear in their own eyes, but that view doesn't have to be true.&nbsp; Point out a clearer picture.&nbsp; Practice painting it yourself.&nbsp; Create buy-in.&nbsp; Invest in people and impact overall culture.</p> 
<p>The good old days are seen through rose-colored glasses. &nbsp;It's like any form of nostalgia. &nbsp;It always looks better from behind. &nbsp;Just imagine how good today will look in 20 years when we make it as awesome as possible (yeah, I said ""awesome"").</p>

<!--more--><p>In school, I was involved in a pretty good food fight in the cafeteria.&nbsp; Mashed potatoes were thrown onto the walls in our attempts to create art.&nbsp; The school did not think it the best use of the food, especially when it moved from walls to people.&nbsp; It was one of the rare times I was brought to the principal’s office (I was usually not caught for the stuff I did, not because I was angelic).&nbsp; Because I had my own skin to protect (from my dad!), I found a way to present information that not only removed any malevolent thought of me, but actually made me sound like a good guy operating in the fallen humanity of school.&nbsp; Brilliant? Yes.&nbsp; True? Ummmmmmmmmmmmm.</p> 
<p>What if the information is flawed?</p> 
<p>It’s probably due to a few possibilities.&nbsp; One – perhaps there is a gap in the way information is gathered.&nbsp; Maybe there are some steps that have been bypassed due to ignorance.&nbsp; In our efforts to be efficient, we can forego communication steps and not look back.&nbsp; Maybe we didn't know the process or all of the people involved. &nbsp;We can easily assume some “facts” and fill in the blanks ourselves.&nbsp; It’s not what we would like to do, I know, but the pressure of getting things done cause us to create shortcuts.</p> 
<p>Have you ever been in a meeting where you offer a perspective as an absolute, only to find out that most of the room knows pivotal details?&nbsp; And now you look like an absolute idiot?&nbsp; Yeah, it’s never happened to me…I feel badly for you people (an obvious lie if you’ve ever been in a room with me!).</p> 
<p>Secondly, the informed decision may be colored by self-esteem issues.&nbsp; Crazy as it may seem, but there might be among those with whom we work a person or two who are devastated when they are not the founts of information.&nbsp; To that end, they might offer bits and pieces of information so as to try to coax out the rest.&nbsp; When bits and pieces fly around like that, it leaves open inference and flawed interpretation.&nbsp; The decisions made would be based upon granules rather than rocks of truth.</p> 
<p>And then there’s political positioning.&nbsp; I have been in organizations where communication is used based upon maligned purposes.&nbsp; There can be treachery and back-stabbing in an organization with information sharing an easy road to travel.&nbsp; I may only share what I want others to know, with a longer term plan in place to paint someone in a bad light, to make myself seem more important or to inflate the view of the department I lead.&nbsp; Shocking, I know, but it happens.</p> 
<p>For those of us in an HR capacity, we have to be a bit more eyes wide open about information.&nbsp; It is a necessity for us to do our homework.&nbsp; Cultural and relational impact is likely to occur from some of the decisions to be made based on certain information.&nbsp; We can serve in an unbiased manner and gather all of the facts.&nbsp; If we were to slip into some of the posturing or sloppiness addressed above, we compromise our role as a strategic partner to the overall health of the business.</p> 
<p>Over the past few months, I have conversed with some business owners whose experience with HR people has them characterized as “mealy-mouthed” or “chatty Cathys.”&nbsp; What a sad perspective.&nbsp; Is it really likely that our informed decisions will be seen as informed decisions when the impression we give falls into those categories?&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s not about our skin.&nbsp; It’s about our commitment to the senior leadership team to deliver truth that will encourage growth and health for the organizations we serve.</p> 
<p>Really, what’s the worst that would have happened if I just admitted to flinging a spoonful of mashed potatoes?&nbsp; Detention, cleaning it up, some Philly-Italian-style parenting?&nbsp; You gotta have something to go to therapy with, right?</p>

<!--more--><p>When I have given a road for healing to others, it’s not always what I might want to do.&nbsp; I defer to being bitter, angry, vindictive or self-righteous.&nbsp; It’s my nature, and I don’t think I am alone in that.&nbsp; I have a right to be hurt.&nbsp; That person was callous, egotistical or just plain wrong.&nbsp; And now, the relationship is damaged.&nbsp; This damaged relationship is now impacting situations, workflow or other relationships.&nbsp; The impact of this problem is tension, a rift or brokenness and it is far-reaching and, for businesses, costly.</p> 
<p>As the week’s events between SHRM and HRCI have unfolded, I kept coming back to this idea of healing.&nbsp; HR professionals know that we are often (if not always) called upon to mend relationship and change the course of brokenness in the workplace.&nbsp; We converse with the injured parties; we bring our affirming communicative skills to bear on the situation; we coach the parties to seek resolution.&nbsp; We recognize that there really can be someone in the wrong, but that does not have to be where the situation ends.&nbsp; Now that error is seen, what are we doing to mend it?&nbsp; We push for repair and then growth to learn how to deal with similar facts in the future.</p> 
<p>SHRM and HRCI feel a little like Mom and Dad fighting.&nbsp; This week, I have felt like the kid from the marriage watching, listening and being heart-broken.&nbsp; I love both of my parents.&nbsp; I have demonstrated allegiance to both sides and expressed love equally.&nbsp; Just as in most divorce situations, Mom and Dad’s individual needs and wants have evolved for some time.&nbsp; Both sides are looking back and trying to pinpoint when the complimentary paths diverged.&nbsp; And regardless of fault or blame, they are now dealing with the gap that has widened between them and their expectations of each other.</p> 
<p>The kids in a divorce situation want to help.&nbsp; They want things to go back to how they were.&nbsp; They want healing.&nbsp; For us, as HR professionals, we must not choose sides but appreciate each side independently of the other.&nbsp; It’s not our job to fix their relationship; these two sides consist of big girls and boys who can and should find their way to common ground for the sake of the professionals they serve.&nbsp; Just as kids often cannot fix mom and dad’s relationship, we find ourselves heartsick observers.</p> 
<p>What we can choose to do is be a conduit for healing as opportunity strikes.&nbsp; Share with each side how we feel.&nbsp; Maintain the integrity of our roles as HR professionals.&nbsp; Continue to be proud of the growth and accomplishments we’ve achieved that both sides have afforded, whether PHR/SPHR/GPHR certification or volunteer leadership positions in SHRM.&nbsp; We have been cared for by both organizations.&nbsp; Let’s return that care back to the two sides that are in need now.</p> 
<p>Again, healing is a gift.&nbsp; It’s not a wussy, feel good sentiment, but a willful decision with measurable results.&nbsp; That kind of decision ought to be the type that we’re already used to making as HR professionals.&nbsp; Listen up, Kids! There's a problem. Mom and Dad need us now.</p>

<!--more--><p>I loved TV.&nbsp; I guess I still do, though I watch much, much less than I did as a kid.&nbsp; And I could not tell you the last time I held a TV Guide in my hands.&nbsp; So much has changed in that medium.&nbsp; I wish I knew then what I know now about how it would evolve. &nbsp;It would have been great to be at the forefront of the development.</p> 
<p>Our brands need the same care.&nbsp; What are our brands?&nbsp; I think there are a few to pay attention to:</p> 
<p>1 – <strong>Our companies</strong> – The brand identification for our organizations matters.&nbsp; What does the public perceive about your company?&nbsp; What is the messaging?&nbsp; What is it they think of first when they hear your company name?&nbsp; Those answers are a matter of our brand.&nbsp; Do you know those answers?&nbsp; How do you know them?&nbsp; In other words, how were they communicated to you?&nbsp; Companies spend millions on marketing their brand, but can still miss the fact that the messaging is misaligned from the actual company.</p> 
<p>Branding is not marketing.&nbsp; Branding is about the utilization of the brand; it’s about the prep work done ahead of the marketing to the public.&nbsp; Sometimes, companies think that a snappy logo is the brand identification.&nbsp; The logo is really more about marketing than branding (See Phoenix Cavalier’s thoughts at <a href=""http://biznik.com/articles/branding-is-not-marketing"">http://biznik.com/articles/branding-is-not-marketing</a>).</p> 
<p>2 – <strong>Our roles</strong> – There is perspective held by those around us of our jobs.&nbsp; A role may be seen as tactical or strategic.&nbsp; The position we have now may not be what we want for our future, but because the role is seen as one type of position, it can translate to what others might think of what you can do.&nbsp; If the role you’re in is not strategic, but you want that opportunity, then re-branding it is as strategic is necessary.</p> 
<p>Think about the positions in your company that have been changed or discontinued.&nbsp; How did they become irrelevant?&nbsp; Is there danger of that for your role?&nbsp; I worked for a company that saw a particular role as irrelevant and therefore discontinued it.&nbsp; About three months later, there was so much not being done that the short-sightedness was glaring.&nbsp; One VP commented, “I had no idea how much that role actually meant to the function of the department.”&nbsp; The brand of the role was not clear.&nbsp; A brand is simply the message of a product, service, or, in this case, a position.&nbsp; Again, what’s the message of your position to the company?</p> 
<p>3 – <strong>Our competencies</strong> – If a role is to go away, are you going to be swept away with the position?&nbsp; &nbsp;Can the company see the difference?&nbsp; Your skills, knowledge, aptitudes and abilities have a message.&nbsp; Step back for a minute and see if you can read what they are saying to those around you.&nbsp; If you’re feeling particularly brave, ask someone if they could give you 3 skills that he/she sees you demonstrating on a regular basis.&nbsp; Vulnerable, yes, but it could be quite eye-opening.</p> 
<p>When the makers of the TV Guide magazine product imagined their brand, they could only see it as a publication distributed on a weekly basis.&nbsp; As time went on, it provided interviews with TV stars.&nbsp; And once the necessity for a weekly magazine became less relevant, TV Guide moved to creating a TV channel with entertainment news, syndicated shows, reality-based programming and showbiz interviews.&nbsp; The core brand evolved to a fuller spectrum of TV entertainment.</p>

<!--more--><p>My dad used to describe some people as ""liking to hear themselves talk."" &nbsp;There wasn't much substance to what someone was saying, but they sure had lots to say. &nbsp;The only way it made sense for that person to talk so much was that he/she liked the sound of his/her voice. &nbsp;As weak of a reason as that may be, it just may be the best explanation.<br> Substance is needed in our conversations. &nbsp;Too much fluff can fill our dialogues. &nbsp;We talk about inane things that don't matter and don't help us. &nbsp;As leaders, do we know what we're saying and why we're saying it? &nbsp;Is it simply being said because you feel as though something has to be said? &nbsp;That usually isn't a great reason. &nbsp;In fact, it might be counter-productive because, first, it might water down anything of substance you do have to share in the future and, second, it might cause you to say more about something than you ought. &nbsp;The value of communication is a demonstrated leadership quality. &nbsp;Your team will get what you think about verbal communication when they hear and see what you're doing with it.</p> 
<p>The words themselves are not stupid, but rather, not thought through well. &nbsp;Take for instance a recent political &nbsp;election commercial. &nbsp;The woman running for office says that if elected, she would take medicare money from the US government for the state as opposed to the current official who is not. &nbsp;She makes this point and then says, ""and that's the kind of leader I will be."" &nbsp;I scratch my head. &nbsp;Is taking government medicare money a sign of leadership? &nbsp;That's the correlation? &nbsp;Hmmmm. &nbsp;I'm not convinced. &nbsp;Sounds like fluff to me.</p> 
<p>Simply, as leaders in our companies, we have to be thoughtful about our words. &nbsp;What is it we really want to communicate? &nbsp;Focus on that. &nbsp;Make cohesive dialogue. &nbsp;Share one point and connect it to the next in a sensible way. &nbsp;Help others follow your progression.</p> 
<ol> 
 <li>Know what you want to communicate</li> 
 <li>Think through how you want to communicate</li> 
 <li>Clearly share the communication</li> 
</ol> 
<p>I know it's simple, but the amount of rhetoric and jargon we slip into can make our necessary communication with our team ineffective and off-putting. &nbsp;Take the time you need to gather your thoughts and share what you really want to share. &nbsp;I would really like to hear that communication!</p>","https://21594889.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21594889/Imported_Blog_Media/Talk-Talk.jpg","","PUBLISHED","false"

<!--more--><p>Look at the way roles within your company are viewed.&nbsp; Aren’t some seen as more valuable than others?&nbsp; I understand that the COO or CFO is an important role and might have a different level of value to the organization, but does that mean that other roles are not valuable?&nbsp; Too often, we sell new candidates on the stepping stone view of the role they’ve applied for.&nbsp; We apologize for the role, in essence.&nbsp; We see the role as less than what someone should settle for.</p> 
<p>What kind of message is that?&nbsp; Do you expect someone to just take the job because you do a Jedi mind trick? (“This isn’t the job you’re looking for. The job offered will do fine.&nbsp; Move along.”)&nbsp; With such a poor setup, it’s unlikely that a candidate would accept, and if they do, be assured that it’s just to collect a paycheck while the new employee interviews for other jobs.&nbsp; Sad and not encouraging, I know, but truthful.</p> 
<p>Devaluing a position is a cultural nightmare.&nbsp; Take, for example, employees who used to do a job such as what I've described. &nbsp;They feel comfortable to give the “oh, you are the new guy doing this? Ha, good luck!” speech.&nbsp; I understand the teasing and sometimes it just might showcase the familial spirit of the company.&nbsp; However, what isn’t okay is to allow the mocking to be a staple of the workday.&nbsp; Devaluing the job being done is to devalue the person doing the job.</p> 
<p>Listen.&nbsp; For those of who you really know me, you know that I have sensitive moments.&nbsp; I offer sympathy; I empathize with others.&nbsp; The devaluing of a job is NOT a sensitivity-thing.&nbsp; My perspective is not about primarily caring for feelings (although, I am not against that either), but rather it’s about protecting the culture of the company and the “every job is important” attitude.&nbsp; It cannot just be a cute phrase, but belief in action.</p> 
<p>My first on-the-books job was with Friendly’s.&nbsp; I was a dishwasher.&nbsp; Not a glamorous job.&nbsp; I was thrown all kinds of crap and no one said anything to me.&nbsp; I lasted six weeks.&nbsp; It wasn’t because I was too good for the job, but because I was alone and made to feel unimportant.&nbsp; I looked at my job as being less than everyone else’s.&nbsp; I didn’t like that feeling, but the message was clear.&nbsp; But&nbsp;think about running that restaurant without clean pots, pans, dishes or glassware.&nbsp; That job is vital regardless of glamor. &nbsp;It would be out of touch with business necessity for a company to think otherwise.</p> 
<p>So, simply, review those overlooked roles in your organization. &nbsp;Speak into them.&nbsp; Now look at those jobs that are devalued intentionally through commentary and jokes.&nbsp; Fix it.&nbsp; It’s messaging that must be addressed.</p> 
<p>There is nothing wrong with washing dishes for a living.&nbsp; There is nothing wrong with packing and shipping boxes for a living.&nbsp; There is nothing wrong with cutting lawns for a living.&nbsp; There is nothing wrong with waiting tables for 30 years. &nbsp;Nothing at all.</p>

<!--more--><p>Why do we crave it so?&nbsp; I think it’s because we are designed to achieve.&nbsp; We are designed to inspire and to create.&nbsp; We are designed to engage others and to energize our environment.&nbsp; Happiness comes from doing what we are designed to do.&nbsp; The pathing is unique, the skill sets vary and the product takes various shapes, but the outcome is consistent.</p> 
<p>In the human resources sphere, I see lots of well-meaning people put together lots of well-intentioned programs.&nbsp; We seem to think that these programs will fix what ails our people.&nbsp; If happiness is what our staff is missing, no great program will provide lasting impact.&nbsp; Sure, there will be some positive results.&nbsp; Some staff will express gratitude for causing them to think differently about a subject or a process (which is a victory!), but does it last?&nbsp; If one year later, you sense the same rut returning, then what has that program gotten you?</p> 
<p>As taxing as what I am about to say is, over the last 20+ years, the most impactful push towards growth I have been involved with are about the individual.&nbsp; Working with the individual to find what makes him/her tick. Working with that person to see what he/she can bring to the table.&nbsp; Working with that person to see where he/she dreams, finds glimmers of fulfillment, and senses purpose.&nbsp; When we can tap into those things, we find the core of happiness for that person.&nbsp; That is the heart of the matter.</p> 
<p>I believe our staff can find happiness in their work.&nbsp; Our responsibility is work-related as business professionals; however, I understand and have observed an overlap to the personal lives of those we serve.&nbsp; If the core of happiness is pierced and inspired to multiplication, then by nature, an individual will want to design his/her entire life around that exposed core.</p> 
<p>For the professional, we have to make a decision to coach effectively.&nbsp; Coaching is not just about the skill desired or the task to be completed, but it’s about the whole person.&nbsp; I have had many robust discussions with peers regarding this perspective, but I can only point to the lasting impact differentials I see.&nbsp; Those employees that have been coached as a whole person, under the auspices of the work environment, have embraced lasting change and have remained happier than those who have not.</p> 
<p>Happiness is a decision; joy is a state of being.&nbsp; Inspiring the lasting decision for happiness has to be based upon impact and validation.&nbsp; My circumstances may not make me happy today.&nbsp; So what does that mean?&nbsp; Should I be an absolute jerk to those around me (with justification in my mind) because my circumstances suck?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; This is not beneficial to the work environment nor to the person.&nbsp; We have to be content, satisfied, happy regardless of circumstances.&nbsp; It’s a decision for approach and for interaction.</p> 
<p>Find what makes you happy at the core of your being.&nbsp; How does that get expressed at work?&nbsp; How can it get expressed at work?</p> 
<p>And, as silly as this may sound, know what brings you back to center.&nbsp; If you know what makes you happy, and you lose your way, know what triggers will push you back to it.&nbsp; Is it a best friend?&nbsp; Is it a favorite piece of writing?&nbsp; Is it a song?&nbsp; Talk, read or listen.&nbsp; Do what you need to and you might surprise yourself at how happy you can really be.&nbsp; And all that without spending $1095 (I mean, if you want to Paypal me the amount to make yourself feel better, I will send you the link…)</p>

</div> 
<p>As a New Yorker, I use public transportation to get where I'm going. It's generally fast and relatively cost effective (especially when compared to the cost of owning and maintaining a car here).</p> 
<p>It also provides a snapshot into <a href=""http://www.victoriomilian.com/2013/02/a-beautiful-commute-part-2.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">how human beings act</a>. Whether as individuals or in groups, commuters here speak quite clearly--through their behavior, dress, and other means--even as they avoid eye contact. One observation I've made over time is this: <a href=""http://www.anthropologyinpractice.com/2009/10/status-symbols-or-something-more.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">New York City commuters carry lots of bags</a>. Now this is unscientific, but I can say on my normal commute to and from work most passengers carry more than one with them. The vast majority of multi-bag carriers are women. Based (again) on personal observation, most carriers seem to carry one bag for personal effects, and another contains essentials for the commute, such as gym clothes or work items (e.g., laptop, paperwork).</p> 
<p>For me, people carrying multiple bags present a challenge. They take up more room on the subway, which my main form of transportation. When you consider that close to millions of people take the subway on a daily basis, every available inch counts! In addition, I can't help but think that lugging that much stuff around consistently will have an impact on the carrier's health. If nothing else, it probably puts a lot of stress on one's back, shoulders, arms, and legs. I imagine that there's an enterprising chiropractor out there that specifically targets people impacted in this fashion. I know of one that has a sub-practice centered around clients who are in need, due to poor posture related to how they utilize their cellphones!</p> 
<p>With all of this, I strive to carry one bag with me when I'm out and about. Sometimes this presents difficult choices, but for the most part I can successfully balance my needs with my ability. I have bags of various sizes and shapes, and I also try to take care of myself so that, in the event of having to carry a particularly heavy load, I don't overdo it. I also try to carry items that perform multiple functions. For example, utilizing cloud based services such as Evernote, Google Drive, or Dropbox allows me to carry less paper files around. Because they able to be used across multiple devices, I can mix-and-match which ones I carry with me. Most days, this helps me to avoid carrying around my laptop, by far the biggest and heaviest of my work related devices. That being said, I'm overloaded in other ways. It doesn't necessarily manifest itself physically, yet it still can be exhausting. My issue is communication overload. Here's a snapshot of the various communication devices or channels I manage:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Two smart phones (one for work, one for me)</li> 
 <li>Several emails (roughly 1/2 dozen)</li> 
 <li>Fax machine (don't ask)</li> 
 <li>Two physical work mailboxes</li> 
 <li>Two phone landlines</li> 
 <li>Social media outlets</li> 
</ul> 
<p>There's a multitude of methods to reach me. And while it doesn't weigh much physically, mentally it can be a lot to manage and maintain. It demands that I check all these different methods, to insure I don't miss anything important. From a security perspective, the different programs and electronic devices I use means multiple access codes. It's a lot! With that, it's time to start thinking realistically around assessing, consolidating, and/or eliminating these items from my life. Wherever possible, as Erykah Badu would say, it's time to let it go...</p>

Ocean City, 1988.&nbsp; Two recently graduated high school males drive down to the shore to meet up with half a dozen recently graduated high school females.&nbsp; Heaven.&nbsp; Our popularity knows no bounds.&nbsp; We arrive, celebrate with the young ladies for a while and then head to the boardwalk.&nbsp; One of the females asks us all to stop to have our palms read at a kitchy closet-sized boardwalk establishment.&nbsp; Um, ok.&nbsp; I am elected to go first - $3 for one palm, $5 for two.&nbsp; “$3, please,” I say (those of you who know my frugality…stop laughing out loud).&nbsp; My life will be long, married with two children and some nonsense about career and money that were very general in description.</p> 
<!--more--><p>My buddy affirms my willingness to set a tone, as the girls were ooh-ing and ah-ing over my stable future.&nbsp; I was a hot catch.&nbsp; And then one of the girls went next.&nbsp; The fortune teller began very broadly about her successes yet to be – you will graduate college, you will have a good job, etc.&nbsp; But then love came into the conversation and the teller asked if the letters “P” and “J” meant anything.&nbsp; And with that, tears began to fall.&nbsp; The girls huddled together and shared in the heartbreak.&nbsp; You see, this young lady’s last two boyfriends were Pete and Jason.&nbsp; Now, the fortune teller was clearly in the driver’s seat and directed how the rest of the night would go.&nbsp; Needless to say, it was not that lucky of a night for those two recently graduated males.&nbsp; They had to help console the raw emotion of 18-year old girls.&nbsp; Crap.</p> 
<p>As I have had the privilege to work with many companies in trying to develop managerial and leadership skills, questions of predictability come up.&nbsp; Most organizations want to know that if they do “x” will “y” happen?&nbsp; Is it that simple?&nbsp; Basically, “John, can you tell me where we will be in 5 years and will we be successful?”</p> 
<p>Think of the wonderful parents that you had/have (or maybe the wonderful parents that you’ve observed).&nbsp; Have all of their children been model workers or spouses, or human beings, for that matter?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Is that necessarily reflective of the fact that the parents weren’t as great as all that?</p> 
<p>The best coaches and leaders have had players, executives or followers that did not rise to the occasion of their instruction.&nbsp; It has meant that some of those coaches and leaders did not know their environment well or pay enough attention to the talent before them.&nbsp; As such, they made decisions that were not in keeping with understanding what they had to work with.&nbsp; For those leaders, they were replaced by others who seemed to have a better handle on such realities.&nbsp; But on the other hand, some of those leaders were replaced even though the plans were right on the money.&nbsp; Think about Andy Reid’s transition as head coach for the Philadelphia Eagles to the head coach of the Kansas City Chiefs.&nbsp; His plans were very similar, his assessment of talent thorough and the success was immediate in the new post.</p> 
<p>So, how do you predict success, in this case, with talent?&nbsp; Firstly, it’s not a cookie-cutter plan.&nbsp; What worked in one environment might not work in another.&nbsp; There is a need to assess all variables.&nbsp; For the HR professional, we have used SWOT analyses for years.&nbsp; I know that we’ve re-branded this and tweaked it, but in its essence, this is what we should do to profile an organization and to do a deeper dive with talent.</p> 
<p>Secondly, have a bit of patience.&nbsp; You can’t put a plan into place and then look two weeks later for a monster improvement.&nbsp; In my experience, those companies that can show an off-the-charts improvement had to be in a very dire situation to start with, as in “Kitchen Nightmares” with Gordon Ramsey.&nbsp; Let’s hope this is not the situation your company is in.&nbsp; Most talent-related new playbooks take a bit to get used to and to implement with conviction.&nbsp; Acclimating staff to the new rollout of procedure, planning and level of teamwork, for example, needs some time.&nbsp; There is not a quick fix for most companies.&nbsp; And to be honest, you want lasting, not short term.</p> 
<p>And finally, do your homework before hiring.&nbsp; Know the skill set clearly.&nbsp; Understand competencies first.&nbsp; Measure talent by using assessments for coachability, personality, motivation factors, etc.&nbsp; There is great value in investing is such measures first.&nbsp; Don’t be frugal in this (Physician, heal thyself, eh?).</p> 
<p>I know that most companies are hoping to pull a wild card in talent. &nbsp;This isn’t going to be done through luck, with tarot cards or palm reading.&nbsp; It’s going to be done with an educated assessment of the internal truths of the company, the external competitive markets and the ability of the talent at present.&nbsp; Those gaps can then be seen clearer and a plan put in place.&nbsp; I wish it were as simple as a look at my hand to know for sure what the future will bring, but alas, it’s not to be.&nbsp; Plus, I seem to have more lines on my hands the older I get.&nbsp; Not only would I have to ask “what do I do with that,” but also “how did this happen to my hands?!”</p>

To endeavor to lose weight, for example, requires discipline. It requires commitment, determination and resolve. I've been exercising forever. My mom says that when I was a toddler, I used to watch a show, ""Exercise with Gloria,"" on our local Philadelphia station and would imitate the aerobic and stretching moves. I was committed to doing what she did - stance by stance, stretch by stretch. As adults, when we watch someone exercise discipline towards such a health-related goal, we are inspired.</p> 
<!--more--><p>So why does the use of the word ""discipline"" have to change when applied to correction? When I discipline one of my kids, which I hardly ever have to do because they rock (truth be told, they usually have to provide correction for their dad), I'd like to think I offer it as an encouragement towards excellence and validation of my commitment to their well-being. Of course, the relational aspect helps to bridge these intentions.</p> 
<p>In the workplace, can we provide a similar position in how we administer discipline? Think about the goal of discipline at the workplace - it's to change behavior. Let's do Psych 101, shall we? Behavior modification is best achieved through a few steps at the workplace:</p> 
<ol> 
 <li>Define the problem for the employee and allow the employee to ask questions for understanding</li> 
 <li>Discuss practical ways to address the issue and allow for collaboration, when prudent, from the employee</li> 
 <li>Ensure the active behavior changes are both initiative and reactive in usage (What will I do differently? - <i>initiative</i>; How will I respond differently in the next similar situation? - <i>reactive</i>)</li> 
 <li>Hold the employee accountable for the agreed upon changes</li> 
</ol> 
<p>Very simple and straight-forward, right? Well, the list may be, but the implementation will take more effort. For some of you, your companies already engage in this type of positive discipline, but for many, this represents a counter-culture method to the argumentative, vindictive or stoic nature of discipline currently in place. We know that long-term behavioral changes come with deeper connectivity to the issue at hand and to the solutions that will affect the desired change. Whether it's lateness or a problem with productivity, if we can provide discipline that outlines clearly the issue, the solution and the method to achieve it with collaborative understanding from the employee, it's a home run.</p> 
<p>We get to be the ones who enact such change in approach to employee discipline. Don't wait for your boss, your managers or the world, for that matter, to change first. From a scientific and measurable way, we can show that approaching employee discipline from this angle will bring a marked difference. Discipline is not a scary word or activity. Now, strap on your Thigh Master while at work and get to it! Get motivated to change employee discipline!<br> &nbsp;</p>

<p>True engagement is about connectivity.&nbsp; For business-minded people, this means connection to competition, market conditions, market changes, talent trends in skill sets and training, strategies around retention and succession planning, etc.&nbsp; I will be relevant when I am relevant.&nbsp; I don’t look or sound relevant alone; I am to be relevant in what I do, too.&nbsp; Often this requires an investment in time to determine where my resources are better spent moving forward.&nbsp; I assess situations, weigh the facts, research what I don’t know and make decisions.&nbsp; This screams of relevance.</p> 
<p>As people, we yearn for connection to others, to ideals, to purpose.&nbsp; When something is out of line, we seek to find a replacement for what’s missing.&nbsp; One of my recent favorite actors died this week.&nbsp; Phillip Seymour Hoffman could draw you in to the role he was playing.&nbsp; You believed it was real.&nbsp; You tracked with him.&nbsp; You could connect with the performance.&nbsp; Out of the limelight, he struggled with the same things we all struggle with – relationships, meaning, direction.&nbsp; What he ran to for answers did not provide what he was ultimately looking for, but don’t think he’s alone in that.&nbsp; I am not speaking of drug use, but on a grander scale, running to something easy to fill the deeper.</p> 
<p>Our relevance is not bound to coolness.&nbsp; When I sit and listen to someone pushing a book about how to be relevant to Gen Y, for example, I could get up and punch them in the middle of their speech. (I mean, slap them, ‘er, rather, give them a stern glare…ah, that’s more HR).&nbsp; Tell me how to measure competition better, how to measure and read financials better, how to discover better talent and recruit more effectively.&nbsp; That’s what will make me relevant to the workplace, not a Blu-ray in the breakroom or $5 Starbucks gift cards on an employee’s birthday (OK, I don’t really mind that one, but…).</p> 
<p>Your connection comes from putting yourself in places to be connected.&nbsp; What are you spending your time on?&nbsp; Is it profitable?&nbsp; Is it bottom-line driven?&nbsp; We are so much better than flash and glitz; we are substance.&nbsp; Our purpose comes from pursuit of such things; work to fight against those things that would distract us from our meaning.&nbsp; We have depth.&nbsp; We bring purpose to the table for others to share.&nbsp; We are relevant to our companies, our homes, and our country when we pursue connection to real, lasting principles.&nbsp; For our business communities, these principles must be foundational and returned to time and again.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There will come a time when I will no longer be able to physically pursue some of these things, and as such, my relevance may slip.&nbsp; May I remain strong in my core to not become discouraged.&nbsp; My mind may want more, but my body may hold me back.&nbsp; But maybe, by that time, the Ronco Relevance Infuser will be on the market.&nbsp; Of course, I will be first in line…SMH</p>

"Humareso Blog","Papa Don’t Preach","Papa Don’t Preach – Humareso","en","https://blog.humareso.com/papa-dont-preach","John Baldino","","“Make it work.”  I love this phrase.  It brings to mind those hard-nosed, over-working small business owners who are keenly aware of the limited resources ","2014-01-16 05:00:00","2022-05-26T21:12:23.711Z","<p>“Make it work.”&nbsp; I love this phrase.&nbsp; It brings to mind those hard-nosed, over-working small business owners who are keenly aware of the limited resources they have.&nbsp; They have little time for holding hands and for coddling employees.&nbsp; In essence, “You can’t do it? Then get out” is the attitude.</p> 
<!--more--><p>The major metropolitan areas on the East Cost of the US that I have engaged with throughout my career (Philadelphia, New York, primarily) are full of small business owners.&nbsp; Many first generation citizens built their businesses on the 24/7 principle of work ethic with little concern for how much PTO they’ve accumulated or if there is an ergonomic chair for them to sit.&nbsp; They busted their humps and created an atmosphere of hard work above all.</p> 
<p>And while I love this (work ethic matters!), I have also gotten to watch these family-run small businesses push their children into roles that they have little giftedness in or desire to do.&nbsp; The guilt of what a grandfather and father have done to build a company sits on the son/daughter who is primed to take over, despite the fact that the son’s/daughter's talents do not lean towards running this business.&nbsp; These conversations are very difficult for a son/daughter to have with dad; there is so much of a personal nature behind it. &nbsp;A father might preach the painful story of how the business began and the work it took to build it.&nbsp; Guilt can easily set in.&nbsp; Ideally, the father will understand and support his child's choice, but often I have seen a dismissal of such a desire and a fatherly push to take over the company.</p> 
<p>Perhaps it’s from this traditional thought pattern that some management holds hostage employees who need to go.&nbsp; Companies can find themselves in the unfortunate circumstance of desperately keeping employees because of their knowledge of systems, processes or product despite their lack of cooperation with other staff or overall lack of connectivity to the organization’s mission.&nbsp; The employee has shown that he/she is disinterested and demotivated, but because he/she has been there for some time and knows everything, we have to just deal with it.</p> 
<p>Managers have encouraged, yelled, cried with and threatened these employees.&nbsp; And to the detriment of some companies, some of these employees have been promoted through the years and now serve in leadership-type roles (supervisors or managers).&nbsp; Why are these flakes promoted?&nbsp; How is it that the apparent reward of knowledge solely over the full package of long-term connection is quality enough to promote someone like this?&nbsp; Companies find themselves stuck to do this.&nbsp; Well, get un-stuck!</p> 
<p>Our places of employment are not Guantanamo.&nbsp; We are not holding prisoners, but employing people (I know, some employees think the former, but don’t you believe them!).&nbsp; If someone is not the right fit, then plans need to be made to transition this person out.&nbsp; Employment at will is still a valid policy in the US and is allowed to be used, as long as it does not conflict with other legislation and policy.&nbsp; So, set up knowledge-sharing opportunities so that those who you do see a future with can learn from those who should go.&nbsp; The words here are simple, but the action of them is tough.&nbsp; Managers think about the chaos that might occur when so-and-so is fired.&nbsp; If our employees are not prisoners, then why is management?&nbsp; The work-relationship is not about that.</p> 
<p>If your father said, “you have to work this company and that’s final,” there is more to work through emotionally and relationally rather than just professionally.&nbsp; In our workplace, most of our relationships are not familial.&nbsp; We’re not disappointing two or three generations.&nbsp; Management has a job to do.&nbsp; Finding and keeping talent that will move the company forward is part of our responsibility, just as moving out that talent that is destroying or, at the least, stagnating the mission.&nbsp; And to be honest, we’re not doing any favors to that individual employee who doesn’t fit.&nbsp; Let that person discover what he/she should connect to in a new organization. &nbsp;&nbsp;It’s okay; we’re not their father.</p>

"Humareso Blog","4 Minutes","4 Minutes – Humareso","en","https://blog.humareso.com/4-minutes","John Baldino","","Dynamic, collaborative relationships are desired.  Most companies that I get to work with are often eager to find professionals who understand how to make ","2014-01-06 05:00:00","2022-05-26T21:10:20.865Z","<p>Dynamic, collaborative relationships are desired.&nbsp; Most companies that I get to work with are often eager to find professionals who understand how to make an impact with the skill set they have while being respectful of the authorities in place already.&nbsp; Smart employers often seek to find these exceptional people with vigor.</p> 
<!--more--><p>So, where are these people?&nbsp; Do they exist?&nbsp; After speaking with some of the ones we get to work with at Humareso, I would say 9 out of 10 have become discouraged about the talent pool.&nbsp; Whether it’s a non-committal attitude, a desire for a list of all benefits offered by the company prior to the first interview or an awareness that the depth of work ethic displayed falls short of what’s actually needed in the workplace, these employers have dejection written on their metaphorical faces.</p> 
<p>People, let’s display what should be displayed, not just as an appearance, but as a true picture of the qualities we possess.&nbsp; Do I think that all candidates fall into the descriptors above?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; However, do I think that these employers are wrong?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; They are responding to what they see.&nbsp; And remember, what they ""see"" is not always viewable.</p> 
<p>I sometimes wish that everyone’s skill sets could be viewed, such as what a model has to do for his/her interviews.&nbsp; Show me what you can do.&nbsp; You can sit all day and <em>tell me</em> how great you are, but it’s better when I see you get up and walk the catwalk.&nbsp; The tangibles are visible.&nbsp; How do you move?&nbsp; What does your face do when you walk?&nbsp; Do you capture the look we want?&nbsp; It takes about 4 minutes to know.&nbsp; So, theoretically, can you show what you must in 4 minutes?</p> 
<p>Most potential employers conducting interviews say they can tell within a few minutes if you have what it takes.&nbsp; So, if the interview is a half an hour or longer, what is happening in the interviewer's mind?&nbsp; You’ve got to make a quick, competent impression as an applicant.&nbsp; The shortfall here is part of the reason that these potential employers feel that there is a lack in the talent pool.&nbsp; They struggle to know what you know because it’s not presented in a coherent way.&nbsp; If you have four minutes, what do you want to share?&nbsp; Practice.</p> 
<p>OK, naysayers, I hear you.&nbsp; “Yeah, but John, when I walk into an interview, I don’t get to dictate the questions.”&nbsp; After years of witnessing interviews, I would have to say that more than half of those times begin with a potential employer asking one of the following questions to start out:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Can you tell me a little about yourself?</li> 
 <li>Why are you leaving your current employer?/Why did you leave your last employer?</li> 
 <li>Why did you decide to apply for this position?</li> 
 <li>Why should we hire you?</li> 
</ul> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Think about what you can do with the answer to any one of these questions.&nbsp; Can you give them a great snapshot of your competencies, personality and work ethic in four minutes by answering one of these first questions?&nbsp; Heck, yeah (Sorry, I will tone down the language moving forward).&nbsp; Practice what that response is.&nbsp; Look in the mirror and work it out.</p> 
<p>However, I have to address those who do practice the answer.&nbsp; Can you act like you believe what you’re saying?&nbsp; The words are not the only important part, but the facial expressions, body language, inflection and lilt in your voice, etc., too.&nbsp; Robots are not attractive and will not communicate who you really are (unless you really are a robot, and in that case, please be sure to check “other” in the Self-Identification section of the application).&nbsp; Being believable is done when you are believable.&nbsp; Crazy, right?</p> 
<p>Authenticity begins with a belief in who you are and a confidence in it.&nbsp; You might not be a fit for every company, but you are a fit for <u>a</u> company.&nbsp; Your disillusionment with the process of finding a job can be seen clearly in the first four minutes, even if you’ve practiced your answer.&nbsp; The spark in your eyes is dim, the life in your voice is weak and the enthused body language is replaced by a slouch.&nbsp; Be prepared, yes, but be engaged, too.</p> 
<p>I do believe that the talent pool needs to get stronger in certain skill sets (technology, written communication and mathematics) and in presenting those aptitudes.&nbsp; I believe it takes work to get the job you want to get.&nbsp; I don’t believe that you should just hope it works out.&nbsp; Rather, work it out.&nbsp; Do what you have to do to be enthusiastically ready for an interview.&nbsp; Share with those potential employers why it would be great to have you as an employee based upon a clear and vibrant expression of your competencies.&nbsp; Believe in who you are.&nbsp; You’ve only got four minutes.</p>

We can really get great at showcasing our ability to deflect responsibility and avoid consequences. In my life, I have known people who were great at this. Some might even say I know how to do this well. Perhaps they are right, but it seems to be such a requirement in the workplace that likely I've adopted methodology.</p> 
<!--more--><p>Remember when Milli Vanilli were caught lip-syncing. And then we found out they didn't sing the songs that they won Grammys for. And then they were embarrassed. And then they blamed the record company. And then they blamed the pressure to succeed. (And then they released a demo of them actually singing? Just awful, by the way) Lots of blame being tossed around.</p> 
<p>And why? Why is this the norm? Maybe some of it comes from the overbearing nature of some moms and dads (it's always about mom and dad, isn't it?). ""Little Jimmy"" could do no wrong in school (""it was that lousy teacher""), in sports (""the coach never gave him a chance"") or in his first job (""it's the summer and they wanted him to work 8 hours in one day...the nerve!""). Mom and Dad could have meant well, but instead shut off the ability to fail, to stumble, to learn from his/her mistakes.</p> 
<p>Maybe it's because our society doesn't want to hurt anyone's feelings. I work with many companies that are corporately held in another country. When those CEO's engage with US workers, they notice how quickly feelings are hurt. It's an oddity to most of them. Are we too sensitive? Maybe. I mean, just because I still cry at the end of every repeat episode of <u>Touched By An Angel</u> doesn't make me sensitive, right? But I digress...</p> 
<p>It's not unusual for an employee to blame another employee or a process as the reasons why something didn't work or why he/she was unable to complete a task appropriately. There may very well be truth to what that employee shares, but does it excuse the employee from getting the job done? Some companies that have stagnated find themselves making excuses along with employees as to why things aren't working. We think that more policies, more parameters, more rules, more goals, more more more will motivated change in process, in employee attitude, in results. OK, America, how's that working out?</p> 
<p>If you don't like that your employees do it, have you checked to see if they are learning by example? Of course, this is not going to be the case in all situations. There is some tough love needed with some employees. They need to know that it's not okay to just wait for everything to be fixed before they work harder, smarter, better. They have to be accountable to their performance. If something is not right, what have they done to bring it to the right channels or, even more so, to try to correct it? We want to encourage innovation, critical thought and a healthy work ethic.</p> 
<p>But sometimes, as I said, the company leadership has fallen into an excuse-laden mode of operation. Once we find the right people, things will get better. Once the new product line is tested, we will start to make money. Once the economy changes, we will be in better shape. I cannot tell you how many CEO's have said or thought that a new political party in power would change everything. It's not Bush's fault your company isn't working out nor is it Obama's fault. Of course there are things we wish they had done differently to help US companies, but regardless, it's the company leadership's responsibility to make things work in the context of what is, not in what's wished for.</p> 
<p>Survey the environment, study the competition, take financial management courses, work with experts...do whatever it takes to make your company great. If you are a business leader, take that role seriously and expect it to be hard. If you are an employee, figure out ways to make your job work the way it ought to so that you can achieve the results expected.</p> 
<p>For all of us, life is not about waiting for things to work out. You probably won't hit the lottery. You probably won't retire at 40. You probably won't get your way in everything. So what does that mean? Blame? For our company? For our spouse? For our children? For our parents? Really, think. What does that get us?</p> 
<p>Be committed to excellence, not blame. Be willing to own what you are not doing well and then decide to change. Seek help. Seek collaboration. Seek ingenuity. We're much better than blame. Divert those energies into something remarkably positive.</p>

<!--more--><p>It reminds me that my life means much more to many more than I realize. &nbsp;It's so very easy to be swallowed by duty and responsibility. &nbsp;I have a family, a job, a church...I define myself by function. &nbsp;And yet, what matters most is not those roles but the way in which those roles impact the relationships connected - the people who value the work I do, the involvement in my church programs or the love in action for my family. &nbsp;I define my life by what I do. &nbsp;Gratitude shakes me back to what my life should really be about - relationships.</p> 
<p>The story of my life has been marked by incredible difficulty and incredible pain, but those things do not define me. &nbsp;If it does, it takes my eyes off of the incredible beauty and incredible blessing in my life. &nbsp;So many people, so much love, so much to appreciate. &nbsp;Each one of us has a decision to make each day - am I going to be a benefit or a distraction to those around me? &nbsp;I can control my behavior...I am not a victim. &nbsp;I can rise above the pettiness around me, if there is any. &nbsp;I can choose to be a beacon of positivity in my work culture. &nbsp;I can be grateful for where I am.</p> 
<p>Gratitude is powerful. &nbsp;I am amazed constantly at the impact of being thankful. &nbsp;I don't know why I am amazed. &nbsp;I have seen it happen plenty. &nbsp;But I forget so easily.</p> 
<p>During this week where it's easy and convenient to be thankful, let's think about ways that we can be more grateful all year. &nbsp;I know that I can raise high the banner for what it will do to the workplace or to the family, but I think it's more than that. &nbsp;When a habit of gratitude is lived, a life is really lived.</p> 
<p>The story of my life needs to be about being thankful. &nbsp;This isn't about self-help. &nbsp;It's not about being a great leader. &nbsp;It's not about being a good employee. &nbsp;It's about you. &nbsp;All of those things mentioned will happen when you're grounded. &nbsp;And gratitude is grounding.</p>","https://21594889.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21594889/Imported_Blog_Media/thankful2.jpg","","PUBLISHED","false"

<!--more--><p>This movie has been shown hundreds of times on TBS and the like. &nbsp;It's sold thousands of VHS and DVD copies. &nbsp;And it continues to sell. &nbsp;So why? &nbsp;For those of you familiar with my deep love for Molly Ringwald, I will leave that aside as a reason (hard for me to do). &nbsp;Part of the appeal is the nostalgia of the 80's. &nbsp;Those of us who hit their teens sometime during that decade find that this movie, perhaps more than any other, defines our generation. &nbsp;The characters struggle with identity and their place in the world. &nbsp;The peer pressure, the temptations of life, the masks needed to be worn, the inadequacy of self - all of these are themes, still relevant today.</p> 
<p>It's brilliant, actually, that Comcast is using it. &nbsp;The movie is a microcosm of life beyond the teenage years. &nbsp;Many of us work in places where we have to mask ourselves and pretend that all is well when it very much is not. &nbsp;And, to be clear, this is not necessarily an indictment on the workplace or company; it may be that your continued poor view of self haunts your everyday existence and causes you to maintain appearances using all of your energy. &nbsp;Letting your guard down is not an option and perhaps there is no real outlet for it.</p> 
<p>I am aware that counseling is available for the deeper issues; some companies have rather robust EAP's or even in-house professionals. &nbsp;However, the reality is that most of us won't use those available services or seek outside help for what we would call ""it's just how I am."" &nbsp;Going home after work and popping on ""The Breakfast Club"" while crying might be all the therapy needed. &nbsp;I have experienced workplaces where the demand is great and the care for people is not. &nbsp;I have also been at workplaces where the care for people is high, but the facade to be okay and participate with others is crushing. &nbsp;Not everyone is the ""kum ba yah"" type to be okay with HR's latest and greatest team building program. &nbsp;HR can encourage, albeit unintentionally, poor self-esteem (I can't do what these people can do), dishonesty (a lack of people being able to be genuine) or compartmentalization (I need to work a certain way and fit into a certain box).</p> 
<p>Let's not be offended by this. &nbsp;Let that go. &nbsp;It's not about you. &nbsp;It's about the companies we work for and the employees we serve. &nbsp;So, ask yourself, what have I forgotten about people that I need to re-learn? &nbsp;Take some time to consider your company to jar your memory. &nbsp;Does peer pressure still exist at work? &nbsp;Is it positive in that it's about performance and cultural health? Or is it about high school groupings all over again? &nbsp;Who are the Cool Crowd and how do they keep the Dorks out? &nbsp;How do people sit in the breakroom? &nbsp;Look, this is just one stream of thought - there are MANY to consider. &nbsp;But we ought to think about the Ally Sheedy's and Anthony Michael Hall's of our companies. &nbsp;Where do they fit and are they fitting well? &nbsp;Don't forget about them.</p> 
<p>And yet, I would also submit that the Molly Ringwald's and Emilio Estevez's don't have it all together either. And sometimes, we in HR feed those roles and allow little room for them to say, ""Enough!"" &nbsp;We build programs around the funny guys, rather than around significant content. so that we get a visceral response to affirm our own existence at work - close your mouth and don't pretend to be shocked. &nbsp;I have seen this done numerous times and I am sure it will continue. &nbsp;It's the same line of thinking around some who desire to be seen as ""experts"" or ""thought leaders."" &nbsp;Posting and re-tweeting ""smart"" stuff doesn't really make you either an expert or a leader (ouch).</p> 
<p>I am driven to always come back to the people we serve. &nbsp;We have to consider all of them and how they fit together. &nbsp;""The Breakfast Club"" works well because we see the roles each one plays, the walls come down and true relationship emerges, but here's the reality - they went back to school on Monday and assuredly re-acclimated to their role. &nbsp;They may hate it, but they do it. &nbsp;Adults do it, too.</p> 
<p>Fitting in and finding your place means something to every person (don't even pretend it doesn't - even non-conformists hang out with other non-conformists). &nbsp;Individual identity is precious and should be encouraged to be explored. &nbsp;If you read biographies about some of the great business leaders, you'll see struggles dealt with in these areas for each and the way in which they were fostered through it. &nbsp;We can consider this as we develop our programs and benefits, yes, but more so in our messaging and our recognition language.</p> 
<p>How do all of the pieces fit? &nbsp;That's our job to study. &nbsp;We are to create environments that will allow every person to be free to be the skillful, collaborative person we've hired. &nbsp;That's what our companies pay for and that's what we need them to be. &nbsp;And each person has a role. &nbsp;Don't forget about any one of them.</p>

<!--more--><p>Isn’t it a great cycle?&nbsp; Every year, six months or maybe even quarterly, a manager and a subordinate sit together to review that subordinate’s performance.&nbsp; The process can be draining.&nbsp; I was just asked to review a particular company’s performance review plan.&nbsp; The actual review was six pages to complete (Yikes!).&nbsp; One manager has 20 employees that report to him.&nbsp; Wow!&nbsp; No wonder his response is to hate these reviews.&nbsp; They take an incredible amount of time.</p> 
<p>And what about those reviews, especially if they are annual, that connect directly to compensation.&nbsp; If you hit a 3.4 average, you get a 3% raise, but if you hit a 3.3 average, you only get a 1.5% raise.&nbsp; How many managers have to alter scores so that the employee gets the raise?&nbsp; Is that a real review of performance or just documentation to file so that a raise can be given?</p> 
<p>Part of the basis of philosophy on performance reviews has to be considered.&nbsp; Why are they being done?&nbsp; To justify a raise? To merely say they are being done?&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; If the reason is to actually honestly review the performance of the employee, then we’ve got it right.</p> 
<p>So many managers struggle to be honest about performance.&nbsp; They know that a certain employee will flip his/her lid and make things really difficult moving forward.&nbsp; Really?&nbsp; That’s a reason to curtail a review?&nbsp; It sounds like this person should be encouraged out of the organization.&nbsp; I mean, who’s in charge?&nbsp; If performance standards are not being met and the recipient is belligerent about it, then I don’t see why we’d waste time coaching someone who does not feel he/she needs it.&nbsp; Move on.</p> 
<p>The review is not only a time to tell someone what’s wrong, but also what’s been really good.&nbsp; It’s more than okay to tell them something good.&nbsp; Be honest about it, though.&nbsp; Don’t make up stuff.&nbsp; And don’t try to compare an innocuous “good” thing to a really bad performance reality.&nbsp; For instance:</p> 
<p><em>“Jim, thanks so much for being great during the holiday food drive.&nbsp; You brought in more canned goods than anyone else.&nbsp; Fantastic.&nbsp; But you know, the financial analysis work you’re doing seems to be missing a few components each time and it has not improved.&nbsp; We’ve talked about this before and I am not seeing much improvement.”</em></p> 
<p>Are we really going to compare the holiday food drive participation (non-work essential) to a core job function (directly work essential)?&nbsp; The employees we speak with are not stupid (I know, there are exceptions) and can see that there isn’t much good you have to share if the best you can come up with is that he brought more cans of creamed corn in than anyone else.&nbsp; Let’s think critically on our part and provide dignity on the part of the employee.&nbsp; If the best we got is creamed corn, then shouldn’t we try to move this person out of the organization or at least to a different area where his skills would better align?</p> 
<p>Reviews are to be just that – reviews.&nbsp; There should not be anything discussed in the formality of the sit-down that someone hasn’t heard previously.&nbsp; Using the example above, the supervisor reminds Jim that they had discussed his missteps with financial analysis before – perfect.&nbsp; Now, the review provides an opportunity to right the ship, if it’s not already happened.&nbsp; Develop a plan and a range of results expected with the employee.&nbsp; Use the sit-down to establish parameters.</p> 
<p>The busyness of the daily workload can be prohibitive to formal objectives, but the review provides a dedicated time to develop those goals and objectives.&nbsp; The employee should have a voice in the development of those goals, so use part of that time to do so.&nbsp; It takes some of the pressure off of the manager if he/she can get participation in success.</p> 
<p>I know that in one blog article, we can’t solve the world’s problems with performance reviews, but we can start.&nbsp; Think through what you and your company are doing.&nbsp; Is it working?&nbsp; If not, what has to change?&nbsp; Are you seeking help, if needed, to restructure?&nbsp; If it’s working, why?&nbsp; Keep those core truths close and make decisions that support them.&nbsp; If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The first performance review I received had all 5’s on it and one 3.&nbsp; The three was for employee communications – how I spoke to other employees.&nbsp; Two things, even in my early 20’s, struck me with this.&nbsp; One, I knew I wasn’t a 5 in everything.&nbsp; No way.&nbsp; And the second, for me to get a 3 in one area that had never been spoken about to me previously, must mean that I really stink at it.&nbsp; I was dejected that this was a reality that no one shared with me. &nbsp;I would have addressed it in myself.&nbsp; I was a little bitter towards the manager.&nbsp; I was unhappy with this bomb (in my estimation) being dropped.&nbsp; Oh, and by the way, I got my raise.&nbsp; Effective? &nbsp;Hmmmmmm…</p>

<!--more--><p>In one organization I got to be a part of some years ago, the day shift thought the night shift was a bunch of freaks. &nbsp;They would spend part of their work day and break time discussing how dumb, crazy, stupid, bizarre and idiotic the night crew was. &nbsp;Sounds productive and helpful to the culture, right?</p> 
<p>Management has one choice in this type of situation - Get up. &nbsp;Get out of your ergonomic chair and get on the floor. &nbsp;Engage with the sales teams, line workers and administrative staff. &nbsp;OK, how?</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Change the tone and type of conversation by being an example of healthy communication and encouragement towards goals. &nbsp;Make the decision to not participate in smearing an entire team's or group's reputation. &nbsp;If an employee thinks the night shift is filled with freaks, ask why? &nbsp;Challenge the basis, not argumentatively, but directly.</li> 
 <li>Consistently be seen. &nbsp;This effort cannot be a ""one and done"" deal. &nbsp;It cannot be a once per month which happens to fall during the same time each month. &nbsp;It cannot be done daily at the same time. &nbsp;Mix it up. &nbsp;Catch people outside of habit or comfort. &nbsp;Allow them to be affected by your presence. &nbsp;Your mere presence should give cause for employees to pause and think about what they are about to say to someone else.</li> 
 <li>Don't allow comfort to get in the way. &nbsp;You're going to have to do these things on all shifts. &nbsp;Only engaging with the shift that is most convenient to your schedule will fall short. &nbsp;Those workers on the shift you hardly come to see will know it. &nbsp;It's not hard to amplify an us/them feeling when you're dealing with multiple shifts and teams. &nbsp;The likely winners are usually the Monday through Friday day shift. &nbsp;They are able to work with the bulk of senior management and administrators during the ""normal week"" schedule. &nbsp;You cannot allow that to be the perspective; it will foster the feeling that any other shift is less than desirable. &nbsp;Get up on a Saturday. &nbsp;Go into work at 3AM for the overnight crew (just leave early from work the next day). &nbsp;It's a little inconvenient but it's an appropriate message to those employees.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Simply, be present and persistent. &nbsp;Set a tone that you would want others to follow. &nbsp;Don't wait for someone else to start it (scary, I know). &nbsp;You set the bar and start the momentum. &nbsp;Don't look to the right or to the left for someone else to champion the cause.</p> 
<p>The only freaks that ought to be named should be those who do not extend themselves for the betterment of the company. &nbsp;What would it mean to your company if this were true? &nbsp;The anomalies of the company are those who are not present fully and persistent in protecting culture. &nbsp;Nothing scary about that!</p>

Talk shows are full of people who've chosen a mate to be someone's ""all in all"" and, for whatever reason, it doesn't work out. People tend to want to find that magic in someone that will rescue them from their current situation. We do it with people, but we also do it with stuff. We want that lottery win so bad. We think that will rescue us from our current situation. Then how is it that 70% of lottery winners are <a href=""http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/05/17/18323470-what-could-happen-to-you-tales-of-big-lottery-winners"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">bankrupt</a>? We don't find our hero to be what we expect it to be.</p> 
<!--more--><p>For those of us old enough to remember School House Rock, there was a song called ""My Hero, Zero."" The point of the lesson is that by itself a zero is nothing but put it behind a ""1"" and you've got ""10,"" an increase numerically. The Zero finds itself to be heroic in that it's nothingness turns into value when used in conjunction with another number.</p> 
<p>As ""People People,"" we get so many chances to bring zeroes to heroic levels. I am not talking about budgets (I've tried that before and some accountant always catches my ""accidental"" additional zero at the end of the HR budget), but rather finding value in all of those who work with and for us. The quietness of a worker should not be allowed to signify his/her minor contribution to the whole while the boisterous worker seems to get credit for things he/she had nothing to do with just because of loudness. Cultivating those ""zeroes"" into heroes is part of our strategic responsibility.</p> 
<p>A hero is one who is admired for performing great and/or brave acts and has fine qualities, according to Webster's Dictionary. Aren't there some people in our workplaces that have those qualities and others simply do not know or notice, including the hero himself/herself? Give consideration as to how to cultivate heroes.</p> 
<ol> 
 <li>Look for those who do exceptional work. I'm not talking about the person who answers twenty calls a day whose job it is to answer phones; that is not a hero. We cannot reward basic job responsibilities by calling that person a hero. It has to be great or brave. How about the worker who stays late to finish a project for three weeks without most people knowing? How about the person who looks for ways to improve processes or technology for the good of the company even when it's not in his/her direct job description?</li> 
 <li>Listen to others tell stories. Set the tone for this, though. Someone coming to tell you that Joe is a great guy because Mike, who sits next to him, is tough to deal with and Joe doesn't complain about him. Really? I mean, I appreciate that, but Joe is no hero. What about those of us who have relatives who are annoying to deal with? Where's my hero trophy (just kidding, Family, there's no one annoying in our family besides me)? Cultivate a forum for people to cheer others on by noticing the great or brave work someone is doing. We should encourage our employees to notice great acts from great people.</li> 
 <li>Don't make this about gift cards. I get that we want to reward people and I can appreciate the gesture, but the gesture can become the goal rather than things being done for true heroic reasons - rescue, encouragement, betterment, bravery, etc. A $5 gift card to Starbucks is not equal to someone truly doing something marvelous. And on this note, don't make each month a ""have to"" in finding someone. Haven't you worked for those companies who have an Employee of the Month and wind up picking someone ""who hasn't had it yet this year""? Wow, that's stellar criteria.</li> 
</ol> 
<p>Heroes are not those in front, per se, seeking the accolades. We've got to look for them. The humility coupled with the great or brave act is admirable and sets a tone for others. The culture becomes attuned to the qualities in those being recognized. It sets a pattern that we want repeated.</p> 
<p>I am holding out for a hero in each of your companies. You need one. And lest I forget to say, you may actually be that hero for your company. And if your company hasn't recognized it yet, keep doing what you're doing. It's not for you to determine what management ought to do for you. You just keep doing what you're doing because it's the right thing to do. We are still allowed to do that; no federal or state law requires us to change that practice (yet)!</p>","https://21594889.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21594889/Imported_Blog_Media/MyHeroZero.jpg","","PUBLISHED","false"

<!--more--><p>In part, the hosts are hilarious. &nbsp;Stacy and Clinton, bravo. &nbsp;In part, too, it's because there is the understanding that the clothes don't make you feel something, but rather, who you are is highlighted by the clothes you wear. &nbsp;Personality, professionalism and passion all pour through your outfit. &nbsp;Silly? &nbsp;What does it say to you when someone highly qualified shows up to an interview with ripped jeans and a graphic T? &nbsp;Unless it's Urban Outfitters or a company in your mom's basement, you might be disappointed that this person did not think it worthwhile to dress accordingly. &nbsp;Clothes do make the man (or woman, as it may be), but the tactic of #WNTW is to do so as an output of who the person is.</p> 
<p>The hosts spend time talking to family and friends. &nbsp;They ask the contributor what life has been like, where they want to go in the future personally, professionally, and how those around him/her can know those desires just by the contributor walking into the room. &nbsp;It's not a clean shirt, trendy haircut and new lipstick kind of engagement.</p> 
<p>We can do the same thing...not the wardrobe makeover part (I've seen what some of you wear and you're lucky there won't be an 11th year of&nbsp;<u>What Not to Wear</u>!), but a talent makeover. &nbsp;Some of the issues for our long-term employees are that they've done work a certain way for years and it's tough to get them to try new ideas or new processes. &nbsp;Perhaps they used to try and it didn't work out or the plans were too all over the place, so they don't ""waste their time."" &nbsp;They have gotten used to playing on the same swing set and don't want to hear about the latest and greatest stuff. &nbsp;It's very much like some of the contributors on the show. &nbsp;They are still wearing clothes from the 80's and don't know why they can't get a date or that the dates they do get are psycho. &nbsp;They're comfortable in what they know; ""it's worked for me"" is a common phrase.</p> 
<p>Let's show them how valuable their experience can be in light of new understandings of production, marketing and technology. &nbsp;Let's get them into a new ""outfit"" not because we want to make them look hip, but because it will allow people to engage with them quicker and find out what they know. &nbsp;Take the time to look at how things work in your place of employment. &nbsp;Do the seasoned employees hang out with each other exclusively? &nbsp;How will the younger ones feel okay to engage? &nbsp;What about knowledge management? &nbsp;What if some of those seasoned employees retire...where will that know-how go?</p> 
<p>Assess the environment. &nbsp;Not just the physical attributes, but the cultural attributes. &nbsp;What is it the company values and how is that upheld? &nbsp;Just like the contributor is encouraged to let his/her inner passions and interests shine through the deliberately chosen wardrobe, so too should our companies shine the mission and values through it's outer markings. &nbsp;And that is largely seen in our employees.</p> 
<p>We ought to be the experts at recognizing competencies in our people. &nbsp;We should look for ways to accent and highlight those KSAs in ways that others in the organization will take notice and want to engage. &nbsp;Think of it like dressing someone up for a date. &nbsp;He/She may look good when they walk in the door and cause the date to be thrilled at the sight, but the conversation throughout the date will determine how likely this relationship is to continue. &nbsp;So many companies have thrown thousands at image and surface tactics only to come right back to square one once the hoopla is over. &nbsp;We know better than to fall for that (I hope).</p> 
<p>The territory we're in charge of is our organization. &nbsp;Allow talent to speak through our talent. &nbsp;How can we facilitate the recognition of such talent? &nbsp;How can we get our talent to go deeper and express more? &nbsp;It's our primary job in human resources to manage talent fully (that's a lot of ""talent"" usage, isn't it?). &nbsp;We don't get a $5000 gift card per employee to get it done, but we do get to use the resources at our disposal, which includes our smarts, to make it happen.</p>","https://21594889.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21594889/Imported_Blog_Media/WhatNottoWear.jpg","","PUBLISHED","false"

<!--more--><p>These movies show us that skills, bravery, teamwork and willpower can come together around a common goal. &nbsp;Even for those superstar athletes depicted, the concept of team is learned and he/she realizes that winning cannot be done alone. &nbsp;Years ago, I worked for an organization that would show a movie on Fridays for the sales department. &nbsp;The movie would play on all of the televisions in the sales area, which normally showed CNBC, for about 2-3 hours in the afternoon. &nbsp;The idea was to play movies like this to inspire teams of people. &nbsp;I loved walking through the department during the last 10 minutes of the movie. &nbsp;As much as people were working during the majority of the movie, they could not help but stop cold for those last 10 minutes. &nbsp;Eyes fixed, slight smiles on their faces and the occasional fist of victory lifted (of course,&nbsp;<u>Boiler Room</u>&nbsp;was shown often, too, and that doesn't quite have the same effect).</p> 
<p>People want to be inspired. &nbsp;They want to know that their efforts matter. &nbsp;They want to be valued and encouraged in those success areas. &nbsp;They want to see how they fit into the whole. &nbsp;They want to know that they can win.</p> 
<p>Since we all are people-people, what is our role in building upon this natural inclination? &nbsp;We know that those employees we serve seek success in effort. &nbsp;How can they see how what they do matters for the team? &nbsp;Can this be deepened or better defined? &nbsp;How can you make the pathway clearer? &nbsp;This is not existential in questioning (some would say I am not that deep to go there anyway), but rather practical in nature. &nbsp;I would submit a couple of ideas.</p> 
<p>First, train directors, managers and supervisors to assess talent. &nbsp;We have to show these managers what to look for and how to determine the skills and abilities on their teams. &nbsp;Often, we just let them figure it out, but most times, they don't. &nbsp;Who taught you how to know what you truly have to work with? &nbsp;No one? &nbsp;Well, then, learn first. &nbsp;Seek a mentor or coach of your own and then pass along what you are learning to a director. &nbsp;Inspiration for your teams will settle in deeply if those team members know that you know them. &nbsp;You will be thinking of ways to set them up for success. &nbsp;They will rise to the occasion because you knew, sometimes even better than they did, where to put them and how to use their competencies.</p> 
<p>Management will be proactive in this posture, which may also be a complete departure from how it's worked to date. &nbsp;So what? &nbsp;Show flexibility and effort. &nbsp;If we seek this in our staff, we should represent that. &nbsp;We can share with the executive team what it means to inspire based upon lasting criteria rather than a flash in the pan.</p> 
<p>Secondly, celebrate. &nbsp;The successes, the wins, the records set...all of it. &nbsp;Pizza on Fridays is not celebrating anything proactive. &nbsp;That is a reactive gesture. &nbsp;""Aren't you glad the week is over?"" &nbsp;""Thank God we only have two more hours of work after this pizza."" &nbsp;""Pizza, again?!"" &nbsp;Is this what we really hope to send as messaging or hear in return? &nbsp;I doubt it.</p> 
<p>Celebration is not just about the past. &nbsp;When we celebrate a birthday, we appreciate all that a person is and has done over the past year and further back. &nbsp;But also, the fact that he/she is with us today and what we wish for and know this person will be about as the next year progresses. &nbsp;Wouldn't it be sad to say, ""Happy Birthday! We know that this past year was okay and we really don't expect more from you, but we're celebrating your mediocre life"" (that has a bit of a greeting card flow to it, doesn't it?). &nbsp;We choose to celebrate to reflect on success and to establish a future plan of building upon it. &nbsp;It sets a tone and creates a vision of what success should look like.</p> 
<p>People want to have impact. &nbsp;The movies mentioned early on resonate because of that basic premise within people. &nbsp;It's why a song like, ""Roar"" by Katy Perry means something. &nbsp;We want to be recognized for our strength, for our contribution, for our relationship-impact, for our value. &nbsp;It is something we can do for our teams.</p> 
<p>Get in the frame of mind. &nbsp;Close your door. &nbsp;Stand on your desk. &nbsp;Play this video at a loud volume. &nbsp;Get inspired and roar. &nbsp;Really. &nbsp;Out loud. &nbsp;Roar like a lion. &nbsp;Okay, I can't swear that this is exactly what you should do to get started, but I am loving the visual...</p>","https://21594889.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21594889/Imported_Blog_Media/Rocky5.jpg","","PUBLISHED","false"

 Is money the only reward we push?&nbsp; I have had the consistent message of money in my face all week.&nbsp; Money is all over the place and is a constant source of stress for individuals, couples, families and businesses. &nbsp;Just look at the US Government; the shut down is all about money. &nbsp;Who has it and who does not.
</div> 
<!--more--><div dir=""ltr""></div> 
<div dir=""ltr"">
 Everyone wants to make more and spend more. &nbsp;Powerball and MegaMillions are national stories every week. &nbsp;We want so much to make ""bank."" We regard success as based upon how much you make and what that gets you. &nbsp;As I sit in Miami today, I see tons of Maseratis, Porsches and beyond. &nbsp;The status behind the stuff has value here and elsewhere.
 <p></p> 
 <p>Remember the first season of The Apprentice? &nbsp;A bunch of people gathered together to learn from Donald Trump as to how to be successful (dysfunctional) business people. &nbsp;It was a hit and we were glued. &nbsp;And the main push for each ""employee""? &nbsp;Money.</p>
</div> 
<div dir=""ltr""></div> 
<div dir=""ltr""> 
 <div dir=""ltr"">
  And the rub is that most surveys show that compensation is not the primary driver for employees. &nbsp;How can this be? &nbsp;If we all want stuff and need cash-money to make it happen, then that should be tops, right? &nbsp;Instead, we see recognition, efficiency, loyalty, purpose and effectiveness as tops on various reports and surveys. &nbsp;Money cannot buy these things (the Mob tried to do this and it didn't work for them...how do we expect it to work for us?).
 </div> 
 <div dir=""ltr""></div> 
 <div dir=""ltr"">
  So, why the intense efforts around compensation as opposed to these other higher scoring characteristics? &nbsp;Two realities seem to jump out to me.
 </div> 
 <div dir=""ltr""></div> 
 <div dir=""ltr"">
  First, putting the time into efficiency and effectiveness, for example, takes more time. &nbsp;We seem to be okay to throw money at a problem or situation, sometimes even without a plan. &nbsp;But, the thought of putting efforts into strategizing and being deliberate about enacting change is exhausting. &nbsp;Here's the deal, though, if we don't start doing it, these same people will continue to leave our companies and take the knowledge, skills and aptitudes that we need. &nbsp;As much as the effort costs, in terms of time and prioritization, we need to do it.
  <p></p> 
  <p>Set aside time to sketch out the framework of strategy around talent management. &nbsp;Consider opportunities to influence recognition and purpose. &nbsp;How can employees have some input in these areas? &nbsp;Generate buy-in through inclusion. &nbsp;Ask for ideas around efficiency and then recognize those great ideas.</p> 
  <p>But the second issue could be the executive team. &nbsp;You may be on point with the planning component &nbsp;and put together a framework, but when you presented it to senior leadership, they said ""oh, thank you."" &nbsp;And after that, it went to the bottom of a pile never to be shown the light of day again. &nbsp;So, what to do? &nbsp;Build a business case. &nbsp;Use real numbers around engaged employees versus non-engaged. &nbsp;Use benchmark data to show stats behind your perspective. &nbsp;Make it real to the bottom line.</p> 
  <p>Measure what productivity has been like over the past five years. &nbsp;Is it down? &nbsp;Up? &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;Just lucky? &nbsp;More demand? &nbsp;Great talent? &nbsp;How do you know? &nbsp;Answer those questions and you can start to lay a foundation for the business case.</p> 
  <p>Let's be deliberate in our business partnership in this arena. &nbsp;We know what is ultimately driving employees and money is not the top answer. &nbsp;By the way, I am not saying it doesn't matter because it does (it kinda helps to be able to pay your mortgage, you know?). &nbsp;However, from a percentage standpoint, we spend more time on comp analysis and related issues than we do running after the real top answers. &nbsp;Money is important, but it is not the primary motivator. We know it so let's act on what we know.</p>

<!--more--><p>I enjoy power. &nbsp;Power to create, to teach, to inspire. &nbsp;I am not a fan of the dictatorial or bullying type. &nbsp;Having a voice to engage with a variety of people for a variety of causes because of the power to captivate, to educate and, yes, even to entertain is a gift. &nbsp;To this end, power is about service.</p> 
<p>HR professionals have, at times, become caught up in the desire/need to have a ""seat at the table"" (do you hear me retching at the overuse of that phrase?). &nbsp;In doing so, our eyes become incredibly self-focused and we dwell on ways to show ourselves to be valuable and necessary. &nbsp;We attend seminars that tell us how to get our executive teams to welcome us in with open arms; we listen to webinars geared towards personal advancement. &nbsp;Now, understand that I am on-board with the truths in these things, but I would like to submit that the best leaders I've worked with have served their companies/peoples by example and lead the charge as a result.</p> 
<p>Servant leadership seems to come easier for women. &nbsp;It's not weakness to those who observe and understand. &nbsp;Take Mother Teresa, for example. &nbsp;She had the ear of many world leaders. &nbsp;She created an entirely new religious order of nuns. &nbsp;She spoke and wrote about the issues of poverty,&nbsp;healthcare&nbsp;and hunger to the world who wanted to hear what she had to say. &nbsp;And she earned the right to be heard by caring for thousands of impoverished and diseased people.</p> 
<p>It's not to say that this is only something women can do. &nbsp;As men, we're often not raised to serve others well. &nbsp;We are taught to serve only in as much as you can be served by doing so. &nbsp;And women are not exempt from this thinking either. &nbsp;The workplace has forced this thinking upon both sexes and pushed the boundaries for self-centeredness and self-indulgence. &nbsp;There is a need to return to an air of humility in service so that the cultures we seek to create are founded on lasting principles.</p> 
<p>Talent to lead is a skill. &nbsp;It's not all natural. &nbsp;There are those with a natural inclination to lead, but refinement is necessary. &nbsp;Service to others most often helps to refine with lasting results.</p> 
<p>Lasting results. &nbsp;Now, there is a concept. &nbsp;So much of what we hope to do is short term. &nbsp;Hard work is needed for all efforts, but consistent approach sustains. &nbsp;In this case, leadership that is focused upon those to be served keeps us honest, impassioned and humble. &nbsp;We should want to get better in the ways we can be effective, not only by attending self-help workshops, but by practicing what we preach by serving those to whom we're delivering the message. &nbsp;Mother Teresa didn't decide to do what she did because someone told her to be a great leader. &nbsp;She did what she did because she was driven to serve. &nbsp;The more she engaged with the people she was to serve, the more she wanted to get better at leading the charge for change. &nbsp;She didn't ""serve"" for a while (you know, put her time in) and then move on to the speaking circuit, distancing herself from the passionate purpose.</p> 
<p>We need to keep our heads in the game. &nbsp;We are some of the most incredible professionals to walk the earth today. &nbsp;We have an opportunity to be impactful and engaging, and thereby able to lead effectively. &nbsp;And we can maintain and expand these truths by serving well those with whom we've been entrusted.</p>","https://21594889.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21594889/Imported_Blog_Media/image3.jpg","","PUBLISHED","false"

<!--more--><p>As we've aged (so hard to write that...), we still look to fit in. &nbsp;Often, however, it may not be as much about being popular as it is being relevant. &nbsp;We don't want to be our dads or moms of a generation ago. &nbsp;We don't want to go ""gently into that good night"" and we shouldn't. &nbsp;We should want to remain engaged and informed. &nbsp;We should maintain a voice within our organizations that still speaks to the pulse of the markets, the competition, the corporate philosophy.</p> 
<p>But I would be delinquent if I didn't mention priorities. &nbsp;In our quest to be relevant, we sometimes lose our way in keeping the priorities of our organizations first. &nbsp;Some of you are already shaking your heads in agreement (thanks!), but let's get some perspective on this, as it's not a new phenomenon.</p> 
<p>We know that sex sells. &nbsp;It has done so since time began. &nbsp;Men and women have both used it to be desirous and to achieve goals. &nbsp;Advertisers and marketing executives understand this and regularly use sex as relevant to the generation watching and listening. &nbsp;The philosophy for some major organizations has shifted due to the use of sex to sell product. &nbsp;GoDaddy has had some beautiful women in its advertising and this has been successful for them. &nbsp;Oh, and by the way, they sell website domains and services...very sexy, hence the relevant advertising.</p> 
<p>OK, in HR, we can't use sex (if you are, wow) to sell our relevance. &nbsp;So, what do we use? &nbsp;What is the latest and greatest product, series of lectures, technology? &nbsp;The first component is to remember what the mission of the organization is. &nbsp;All messaging should be tied to that, and if there are messages that don't fit, we should remove them, regardless of how ""relevant"" it is. &nbsp;Secondly, relevance does not equal appealing. &nbsp;These words have become overlapped in organizations. &nbsp;Think about school for a moment. &nbsp;There were days that school seemed boring, tough, annoying, overwhelming and stupid. &nbsp;The appeal of school was not always there, but it's relevance remained. &nbsp;Education is vital to the health and growth of people (we can argue about Algebra later).</p> 
<p>And finally, the method of achieving relevance may not be popular. In fact, sometimes it may be polarizing. When Miley Cyrus performed at this year's VMAs, she delivered what she believed to be a relevant performance. She was talked about for days after the performance, clips were shown over and over again, celebrities were interviewed, etc. The response was divided - some loved it, some hated it. Is she relevant because we were talking about it or is she relevant because her messaging is consistent with the goals of her organization?</p> 
<p>The dictionary defines relevance as ""closely connected or appropriate to the matter at hand."" What does the messaging we deliver in our companies say about our relevance? Are we ""flash in the pan"" messengers? Meaning, we deliver the latest and greatest, and as such, we have employees who pay little mind to it. They know that if they just wait a bit, the message will change again, so why commit? Better use of our time is to remain consistent in the ways in which we deliver product and services to our customers and to relay that consistent message to employees with enthusiasm and openness. Relevance can be enhanced by better connecting it to the matter at hand.</p> 
<p>If we are Brother and typewriters are not what people want any more, then what are we doing to continue to deliver products and services in keeping with our mission of providing office solutions? Understand what's going on in the markets and maintain relevance through offerings. Simple to say, I know, but necessary to unpack with the executive team. Brother, for example, still employs 1100 workers in the US. They care to know how the company plans on remaining consistent in mission in light of changes in technology, usage and competition.</p> 
<p>Sometimes our problem in HR is that we like the shiny new toys. New programs, new tactics, new videos are great, but if they don't contribute to the overall mission of the organization, then they are not relevant, regardless of how much fun they are. To be taken seriously as a true business partner, we have to be able to show how what we do, suggest and implement is driving our company to its mission and related goals. Some of you are doing great work in this vein and should keep sharing your great ideas. And for those of you not doing so, cheer up! Listen to ""She Bop"" (with which I have forever scarred you), re-energize and review the mission. Relevance takes thought...just like Algebra.</p>","https://21594889.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21594889/Imported_Blog_Media/brotherax28.jpg","","PUBLISHED","false"

<!--more-->
<p>Victory is a great achievement. &nbsp;It's worth celebrating. &nbsp;Losing weight is a great accomplishment, but it is not the only accomplishment worth celebrating. &nbsp;In our organizations, we have employees reaching and exceeding goals. &nbsp;Are we celebrating?</p>
<p>As some of you know, I am big on expectations and measurement. &nbsp;I believe that it's necessary to set clear expectations and goals and then follow up to measure how those things are being implemented, reached and if there is a need for change in approach. &nbsp;We need to set our staff up for success right from the start. &nbsp;I am, also, a believer of celebrating with those who meet or exceed those expectations and goals.</p>
<p>In ancient times, the act of erecting a monument to recognize a victory was commonplace. &nbsp;Great kings and conquerors took pride in the work they were doing (however terrible it might have been now that we look back) and as such, wanted every traveler who came into the territory to know. &nbsp;While building a monument out of stone and marble might not be practical or cost-efficient, we can recognize those achievements in public and lasting ways.<br><br></p>

<p>It's also okay to recognize types of accomplishments differently. &nbsp;Someone who meets the quota they were given might not deserve a huge fanfare in comparison to the one who superseded his/her quota by 50%. &nbsp;The type of recognition might vary, but the act of at least throwing a ribbon in the sky is what matters. &nbsp;Motivation from the recognition is a fact.</p>
<p>The Maritz Institute encourages use of a&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.maritz.com/~/media/Files/MaritzDotCom/White%20Papers/Motivation/White_Paper_The_Science_of_Giving_Recognition1.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">BET</a>&nbsp;technique.</p>
<ul>
<li>B - State the Behavior. &nbsp;Let employees know what's expected of them and how it will be measured.</li>
<li>E - State the Effect. &nbsp;The employees can handle understanding how what they do will impact the whole. &nbsp;Let them know what difference they are making by performing the desired behavior.</li>
<li>T - Thank you! Recognize what an employee does out of a spirit of gratitude.</li>
</ul>
<p>And I know the other side of it. I know that we're inundated with gift cards and online point-earnings that can lead to fabulous trips. &nbsp;I know that we're not interested in one more initiative to manage. &nbsp;I know that we're promised the world by technology providers but, at some level, we've got to manage it. &nbsp;I get it. &nbsp;And what I, also, get is that the&nbsp;CBA&nbsp;(cost benefit analysis) around recognition is worth the time and effort. &nbsp;Employees who get to raise their hands in victory by the encouragement of their managers are more likely to learn new skills, to creatively think through current work processes and to lead those around them to a higher level of output. &nbsp;Those are some pretty good reasons to build a monument.</p>
<p>Grab a couple of employees this week or next and test it out. &nbsp;Recognize goals met or exceeded. &nbsp;Share it with teams and divisions. &nbsp;Throw a few ""atta boys"" out there in public. &nbsp;The time spent will be well worth it if it's done consistently and with genuine enthusiasm (not an over-the-top-obviously-not-heartfelt attitude).</p>
<p>And now, I am going to take some pictures with the current monument to victory...an unopened ice cream container in the freezer that's been mocking me since it's been brought into the home. &nbsp;Yeah, baby, willpower!</p>","https://21594889.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21594889/Imported_Blog_Media/valerie-bertinelli.jpg","","PUBLISHED","false"

<!--more--><p>Within our organizations, we should find such transitions. &nbsp;Business has a life to it. &nbsp;There's an ebb and flow. &nbsp;It doesn't mean, necessarily, just in terms of profits, but also in terms of talent, creativity, ingenuity, design and development. &nbsp;We have watched great talent come and go. &nbsp;We have had peaks of incredible and energetic design and then valleys of ""writer's block."" &nbsp;Those of us in the trenches have witnessed these seasons, especially the longer we've been with a company.</p> 
<p>What we may have also witnessed is denial. &nbsp;Denial that this can occur. &nbsp;Denial that the company needs to change and to evolve in order to keep up with the changing seasons, let alone lead the charge in the change. &nbsp;Some of us have experienced our companies putting their shades on and hoping for the best. &nbsp;Hope is a valuable commodity and it sets a tone, but hope does not pay the bills. &nbsp;Action is needed and a plan must be developed.</p> 
<p>Avoiding a reality does not make it go away. &nbsp;As people, we may struggle with this. &nbsp;Our personal lives may contain areas that we don't like; instead of addressing the problem and creating a solution, we may stick our heads in the sand and hope it goes away. &nbsp;How's that plan been working for ya?</p> 
<p>Companies are no different. &nbsp;They are run by people. &nbsp;People who in their personal lives may use avoidance as a coping mechanism. &nbsp;Those people then use similar techniques as they lead organizations or manage departments and teams. &nbsp;They do what they are used to doing. &nbsp;Someone has to jolt those people back to true reality.</p> 
<p>When companies like Singer, Brother and Kodak kept their heads in the sand too long, they missed the boat. &nbsp;Technology and business development moved on without them. &nbsp;How sad would it be for Samsung, Apple or Google to find themselves in similar straits in ten to twenty years? &nbsp;I know that seems unlikely, but I am sure those admirers of Singer, Brother and Kodak would have felt the same.</p> 
<p>HR professionals should be able to have the honest conversation with their leadership. &nbsp;If you cannot, then you might want to start with that dialogue. &nbsp;How can I represent the company effectively in managing talent without having an outlet to debrief, discuss and correct? &nbsp;You've got to have a voice. &nbsp;If you've got that voice, then your company needs you to use it. &nbsp;Examine what can be done better, differently. &nbsp;Look to see what the competition is doing, what the market is doing. &nbsp;Look to see where those things are going. &nbsp;Study your piece of the pie and the pie as a whole.</p> 
<p>Avoiding the necessary changes and the seasons of development will not set you or your company up for success. &nbsp;Wearing sunglasses at night will not change reality once the glasses are removed and the lights are turned on. &nbsp;Speak with passionate intensity around where the company is to go. &nbsp;Have a plan, not a complaint list. &nbsp;Have data, not just a feeling. &nbsp;Have solutions, not just problems.</p> 
<p>And if wearing sunglasses for those conversations makes you feel a little bit cooler, tougher and stronger, then go for it. &nbsp;I have my Wayfarers on right now...</p>","https://21594889.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21594889/Imported_Blog_Media/Tom-Cruise-sunglasses_l.jpg","","PUBLISHED","false"

<!--more--><p>One of my favorite examples is Don LaFontaine. &nbsp;You know, Don. &nbsp;Well, you know his voice. &nbsp;He did movie trailers and some television voiceover work for years. &nbsp;He famously used the opening phrase, ""In a world,"" many, many times. &nbsp;If you're not readily familiar with his work, please allow me to illuminate -&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/4781d17ca3/don-lafontaine-tribute-king-of-trailer-voiceover-from-trailermash"">http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/4781d17ca3/don-lafontaine-tribute-king-of-trailer-voiceover-from-trailermash</a>&nbsp;- (I already see many of you nodding your heads, ""Oh, that guy""). &nbsp;For the movie producers and television executives, Don was sought after as the premier talent for this type of work. &nbsp;He was paid handsomely and had the ability to pick and choose the work he would do. &nbsp;But don't think Don was a slacker. &nbsp;There were days where he would work on 35 assignments...yes, in one day.</p> 
<p>When Don started doing this work, I don't imagine that he thought he'd make millions doing it. &nbsp;He worked because he needed to earn a living. &nbsp;Those executives early in his career recognized his talent and were willing to pay more to have him voice their television openings and movie trailers. &nbsp;The price tag for Don grew over the years and he understood that what he could do with his voice had value. &nbsp;Don also recognized how he could use his talent for good in donating it to charitable endeavors until his death at 68 in 2008.</p> 
<p>Don is a great example of the cost of talent. &nbsp;Was Don worth the cost? &nbsp;Well, since I am writing about him, I am saying yes. &nbsp;He was someone who served consistently in his role and became sought after for his excellence. &nbsp;Don was guided by those who saw something more than he did initially. &nbsp;""Voiceover work is voiceover work"" could have easily been Don's mantra, but he was able to see more by the way those around him responded, including the increase in pay. &nbsp;How are we encouraging growth and optimization of talent?</p> 
<p>One of our traps is that we fight hard to hire someone who we think will become invaluable to our organizations. &nbsp;We just know it and we push for it. &nbsp;When it happens, we're elated. &nbsp;What often happens afterwards is the issue. &nbsp;Where is the plan for growth and expectation? &nbsp;Who is holding the process accountable? &nbsp;How will success be determined and does everyone know that? &nbsp;Watching this prospect leave after one to two years, having never really hit the mark for the organization, is a waste of money and a poor use of time and resources. &nbsp;It will cause those to whom you pleaded at first to not look with favor upon your next fight for talent.</p> 
<p>Our job includes the initial recognition of what could be. &nbsp;Like our friend, Don LaFontaine, a path has to be drawn to communicate vision for what a person could bring to the company. &nbsp;Dream a bit and set the bar. &nbsp;Don't apologize but rather cause someone to feel as though he/she could rise to the occasion. &nbsp;And the stack of money isn't all that needs to be communicated. &nbsp;Dialogue about impact and reformation. &nbsp;Consider how many well-paid executives leave their jobs and why? &nbsp;Often, someone is whispering in their ear a better laid plan for how he/she will bring value to another organization. &nbsp;We need to offer insight into how we see someone's talents benefiting our company today.</p> 
<p>Create those plans. &nbsp;Work with management. &nbsp;Met expectations will show value, to the organization and to the employee. &nbsp;Even the ""small"" roles to the executive are pivotal to the overall success. &nbsp;Consider again, Don LaFontaine. &nbsp;What was it that he really brought of value? &nbsp;A nice voice? &nbsp;Good tone? &nbsp;Yes, but one greater thing. &nbsp;He could use those talents to bring anticipation. &nbsp;A movie executive wants people to come and pay to see a movie. &nbsp;Don could create the desire to want to see a movie. &nbsp;That is pivotal.</p> 
<p>Recognizing the worth that talent brings will require money to be spent. &nbsp;But the price tag for it all is worth it when you align need to expectation. &nbsp;When people work without a charted course, dissatisfaction sets in and a lack of motivation takes hold. &nbsp;And senior executives get frustrated. &nbsp;And HR people and recruiters have to back-peddle as to why this talent that they fought so hard for isn't working out. &nbsp;Redirect those energies by putting it into a healthy plan of expectation and recognition.</p> 
<p>Hear Don's voice in your head talking about you and your company. ""In a world where talent is cheapened and left directionless, one company has the courage to take a stand."" &nbsp;Chills, baby, and I can't wait to see that movie.</p>","https://21594889.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21594889/Imported_Blog_Media/don.jpg","","PUBLISHED","false"

<!--more--><p>Where is Alan Thicke to counsel his son, Robin? &nbsp;He did such a great job as a psychiatrist on Growing Pains...didn't he pick up some skills to use at home? &nbsp;Respect for women is not shown by having them prance naked while you sing, ""you wanna hug me? What rhymes with hug me?"" &nbsp;And we pay money for this? &nbsp;I lived this in middle school fantasies. &nbsp;Is this our adult audience now?</p> 
<p>While the beat is dig-able, for sure, the lyrics/message, not so much. &nbsp;I am no prude, but maybe it's due to how aware I am of what HR gets to deal with on a regular basis. &nbsp;Sexual harassment is not a once in a while thing for many industries. &nbsp;I have worked and do work with companies in the restaurant/hospitality, distribution, manufacturing and banking/finance industries. &nbsp;Ridiculous amounts of sexually-laced communication occur. &nbsp;And the majority of it is assumed to be welcome and conversant, so therefore okay.</p> 
<p>Really? Guess what happens when one of the two participants in ""just"" inappropriate dialogue gets upset with the company for an unrelated issue? &nbsp;I hope you guessed! &nbsp;Everything that once was jovial and understood to be kidding is now represented as unwelcome and forced. &nbsp;Yes, even language - jokes, innuendos, ""you knows."" &nbsp;The liability is great to the company and the risk for the employee's professional future is off the charts.</p> 
<p>Again, it's not about being a ""stick in the mud"" HR person. &nbsp;I cannot tell you how many holiday parties or summer barbecues I've walked into and saw shoulders slump down upon seeing me. &nbsp;You know, ""Uh oh, here comes the HR cop."" &nbsp;Typically, to throw them off, I ask the DJ to play ""Hot in Herre"" by Nelly and stand in the middle of the dance floor to see who will join me (it's really funny).</p> 
<p>HR professionals have to keep the company's best interests at heart and in mind. &nbsp;We have to do that, even when we have to protect the company from the CEO or other C-Suite folks. &nbsp;If we have to engage with employees to keep them from proliferating sexist language or stereotyping, then that's what we do. &nbsp;What's the alternative? &nbsp;To allow it to go on and wait for the company to be sued out of existence? &nbsp;How does that help?</p> 
<p>I know that some of you reading this are thinking, ""Seriously, John? Everyone is just too sensitive."" &nbsp;While I might not disagree with a bit of that sentiment, I do know that something that often helps people to re-focus is to replace the subject of their crudeness or inappropriate language to someone they care for. &nbsp;I have counseled many men to talk to me about how they would feel if another man were speaking of their wife or daughter in the way they had been speaking about a female co-worker. &nbsp;Simple, yes, but often really eye-opening. &nbsp;Many men will tell me that they would not appreciate another man referring to a daughter's body, for example. &nbsp;Well, guess what? &nbsp;Every woman is someone's daughter. &nbsp;Further, they could be someone's wife or mother. &nbsp;The perspective gets real when this is challenged...the lines are not as blurry.</p> 
<p>And I know that women are sometimes the offenders, not the offendees. &nbsp;I realize this, but I am also aware that the statistics point to us guys more as being the ones committing the infractions. &nbsp;We can proliferate the stereotypes of women merely being objects rather than equals.</p> 
<p>Look at recent events in San Diego or one of a thousand other places. &nbsp;And while we can joke about the blurred lines, we know they really aren't. &nbsp;If you have to look around before you're going to share what you are about to share, just shut up. &nbsp;Don't say it. &nbsp;That's your conscience telling you not to open your mouth. &nbsp;Obey it.</p> 
<p>If you are a married man, think about the conversation you'll have to have with your wife to explain why you've been fired. &nbsp;Imagine sitting at the kitchen table sharing that while you and a couple of buddies thought it was really funny to try to get ""Susan"" to bend over often, it didn't end up funny after she proved harassment. &nbsp;You lost your job and she is now suing you in civil court. &nbsp;Makes you re-think things a little bit, right?</p> 
<p>Don't fear, HR. &nbsp;Be the ""Stick in the Mud!"" &nbsp;You're not, but own it if it falls to you. &nbsp;Our lives are not music videos and we are not pop stars. &nbsp;We work in the real world, with real people and real feelings...and real lawsuits. &nbsp;Protect the company and protect the people in the company. &nbsp;Respect is more productive than disrespect. &nbsp;There's nothing blurry about it.</p>

<!--more--><p>For instance:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>If you're applying for a job and the phone number you put on your resume is not the right number, please correct. &nbsp;How do you expect to be reached? &nbsp;Just via email? &nbsp;Sometimes that's not enough. &nbsp;Update your resume to reflect how you want to be contacted and remove any information that is wrong.</li> 
 <li>When you work for an organization, it's not smart to share with others why you hate your boss. &nbsp;It's not smart to do that at work and it's really not smart to do that online. &nbsp;Facebook and Twitter do not need to know that your boss's bad habit of biting his/her nails is leading you to look for another job. &nbsp;They don't care if you're working 60 hours a week but only being paid for 40. &nbsp;They don't care that Swedish Fish have been replaced in the vending machine with low-fat Fig Newtons. &nbsp;Burning a bridge is never a wise, professional decision, especially one that's now in annals of the Internet for all of eternity.</li> 
 <li>A meeting time is just that - a time. &nbsp;When you say that you will meet someone at 3:00, that does not mean 3:15. &nbsp;It actually means 2:50. &nbsp;And don't laugh it off once you arrive. &nbsp;Apologize. &nbsp;The occasional traffic issue will happen and is completely understandable; that's the exception, not the rule. &nbsp;Professionally, look to show your appointment you care by respecting their time.</li> 
 <li>If you use your own cell phone number for work purposes or as you search for a new role, please get rid of the ""please enjoy the music while your party is being reached"" feature. &nbsp;Let the phone just ring, for Pete's sake. &nbsp;I don't want to hear a scene from Scarface, music from Tupac as you voice-over a declaration that you know he's still alive or your child saying ""Wait for Daddy"" over and over again. &nbsp;This is your business line; treat it as such.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>This is not a rant (alright, maybe a little) but rather a reminder to respect yourself enough to know how to engage and behave as a professional. &nbsp;I went to college a while ago. &nbsp;I did not have a class that taught me how to be professional when I left college. &nbsp;I was the guy who wore PJ's to class on occasion, challenged classmates to name the full cast of Love Boat (both character and real names) while instruction was going on and left a drool ring on most of the notebooks I had for class. &nbsp;I needed to be more professional than that once I left college, and I knew it!</p> 
<p>Do we know that today? &nbsp;This is not about age. &nbsp;It's about consideration. &nbsp;Entitlement has swept through our culture like wildfire. &nbsp;We expect others to acquiesce to us. &nbsp;""This is how I am"" is a mantra of freedom that we embrace. &nbsp;The problem is that when you have to collaborate with others and rely on others, you cannot always just be who you are.</p> 
<p>It may be your right to answer a phone saying ""'Sup,"" but is that the way you want to be known? &nbsp;Is that the way you want your company to be known? &nbsp;Let me say that the answer may be yes. &nbsp;But what I do know is that we don't ask first how what we do will reflect the company; we hope that it won't be a big deal as we think about it afterwards. &nbsp;Professionalism takes forethought.</p> 
<p>The workplace is not home. &nbsp;You have to think about how what you do will impact others and what message it will give about the organization. &nbsp;And if you are not working, your potential employer is thinking about how you will fit within the culture. &nbsp;Your entitled perspective, though your right, might keep you from being hired. &nbsp;Humility is a lost art in the workplace and it's one we should display.</p> 
<p>Think about your demeanor. &nbsp;Think about your understanding of professionalism. &nbsp;What do you know versus what do you show? &nbsp;Are they the same?</p> 
<p>Our companies are desperately wanting those who will set the tone for engagement. &nbsp;It is about skill sets. &nbsp;It is about education. &nbsp;It is about abilities. &nbsp;It is, also, about professionalism. &nbsp;We can present all of what the company has and knows in a broader way if we know how to appeal to a broader audience. &nbsp;Professionalism takes knowledge, thought and practice. &nbsp;It's just like how I worked on knowing the full cast (both character and real names) for Eight is Enough. &nbsp;Ah, college...</p>","https://21594889.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21594889/Imported_Blog_Media/eight-is-enough-200a030110-fp-1267465454.jpg","","PUBLISHED","false"

<!--more--><p>The music came on and my body began to show off some pretty dynamic moves. &nbsp;Kids were all smiles as they watched in amazement (or maybe they were laughing at me, but I like my version better). &nbsp;After it was over, I secured my $5 and received compliments from friends and the parents of the birthday girl. &nbsp;Everyone knew at that moment that I could dance, &nbsp;including me.</p> 
<p>In our organizations, I believe that our outlets of creativity and expression have a place. &nbsp;While I would not jump on my desk and bust a move (yeah, I just said that), I use those creative opportunities to prep me for engagement at work. &nbsp;Energy levels are up when I dance or workout or have an opportunity to cook a great meal the night before or read a great book or swim in the ocean or...you get the idea.</p> 
<p>Look to what you love and channel that in the work you do. &nbsp;Focus on the energies and levels of health it gives you. &nbsp;Our companies do well when we encourage staff to find and embrace talents and outlets. &nbsp;Employees show increased engagement scores when companies encourage these outlets. &nbsp;Organizations like Starbucks, Harrods and Pixar bake into their mission language commitment to creativity in their employees and fostering any opportunities to participate. &nbsp;The investment of encouragement does not cost a company very much - some time in conversation and affirmation.</p> 
<p>One of the truths from such creative pursuits is that it gives us a chance to do something in freedom. &nbsp;The rules aren't seen as rules but rather parameters for us to be free. &nbsp;Think of boxing, for example. &nbsp;Gyms are offering forms of boxing as an exercise alternative. &nbsp;To box, you have to have an opponent, a ring, some gloves and timed rounds. &nbsp;Those rules are not burdensome but serve to surround so that the participants can focus their efforts on boxing with style and form, with paced breathing and movement and with concentration on his/her opponent. &nbsp;The rules aren't seen the same way that the rule about not eating at your desk at work is seen. &nbsp;We enjoy the freedom.</p> 
<p>However, one point that presents difficulty for some is the identification of such interests. &nbsp;For some folks, knowing what makes them energized is not so apparent. &nbsp;They have hobbies, but sometimes those hobbies have become chores. &nbsp;Scrapbooking is a great example. &nbsp;When you start a hobby like this, the joys might be in the organization of the area to work, reviewing tons of photos and the memories recalled and the completion of the first book. &nbsp;Nice. &nbsp;By the 8th book, people start to think about ""just getting it done"" because it's taking too much time and the creative outlet it was supposed to be is now a mess on a desk.</p> 
<p>Suggestion: take an assessment. &nbsp;Just what you'd expect from an HR guy, right? &nbsp;Well, right. &nbsp;We believe in assessments for work improvements, right? &nbsp;Please be nodding your head yes. &nbsp;We use skill inventory surveys, compatibility exercises, personality testing and the like all to improve our culture, the fit among our people and to explore new veins of growth from within. &nbsp;Why would it be a shock to encourage the same testing usage for passions? &nbsp;If we want to develop people, it cannot be in a vacuum of work. &nbsp;Who they are is who comes to work. &nbsp;By providing some tools to help those who don't know what they love or how to use what they love to energize their lives, we are helping to impact the whole person, which includes the one who comes to work!</p> 
<p>Do a little research on these tools. &nbsp;There are many out there so be careful. &nbsp;Look for data and responses from people who've used it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Take some of them yourself. &nbsp;Maybe you'll be reminded of passions that you've long since laid aside for some reason. &nbsp;Dancing, singing, working out, painting, cooking, sewing, playing sports, fixing cars...find out what makes you alive. &nbsp;And then, do it. &nbsp;Shake that groove thing.</p> 
<p>I still dance (much to the dismay of my kids). &nbsp;I can wobble, dougie, slide, gangham style and some party rock anthem moves. &nbsp;It's funny to watch me do the running man, pop and lock and bust out some Kid 'N Play moves from back in the day. &nbsp;It's a great release and always makes me smile. &nbsp;And so, at work, when someone walks over to me to complain about the choices in the vending machine (again!), I can keep a right perspective and a healthy mental outlook because of the outlets I have and am using. &nbsp;I might be swinging my hips back and forth while he/she is talking to me, but hey, at least it's on beat.</p>","https://21594889.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21594889/Imported_Blog_Media/kent.jpg","","PUBLISHED","false"

<!--more--><p>I can actually feel your head nodding in agreement as you read. &nbsp;I am not alone and neither are you. &nbsp;We are so full that it's no wonder so many of us struggle with depression and anxiety. &nbsp;And to top it off, do the majority of us feel as though our time is being used well? &nbsp;With many companies still working under the ""doing more with less"" philosophy of talent management, our employees feel this, too.</p> 
<p>All of the ideals that used to energize us and we would pursue with passion have become chores and duties. &nbsp;We've allowed our focus to be on schedules and meetings rather than conversation and passion. &nbsp;Simple to say, but true nonetheless. &nbsp;So we have to consider and adjust. &nbsp;For instance, look at what you've done over the past two weeks of work. &nbsp;How much of it was truly productive?</p> 
<p>I had the absolute privilege of speaking with someone recently who shared honestly that as successful as he was, he had allowed his self-esteem to be tied to his performance at work. &nbsp;He was valuable and regarded as such. &nbsp;This pushed him to work even harder to keep that status. &nbsp;In doing so, he lost sight of him. &nbsp;He began to see himself as only about this one successful role, this role that kept him swallowed. &nbsp;I found myself nodding in agreement with him. &nbsp;It makes sense, doesn't it? &nbsp;Your company sees real, true, measurable value in what you do and how you do it. &nbsp;Your company wants to encourage more of that behavior and those results (and rightly so). &nbsp;Your company is where you spend a good bit, if not the majority, of your time. &nbsp;It is very easy to tie who you are to what you do in this one, albeit large, area.</p> 
<p>The cycle looks just like running on ice. &nbsp;You keep putting effort into the motion of running, but it's not very pretty and it really doesn't get you as far as you think. &nbsp;Perhaps there is success in what you are doing, but is it as successful as it could be? &nbsp;The baseball player who is hitting .213 may not seem so great, but he does if the rest of team is batting under 200. &nbsp;It's relative. &nbsp;You can advance in placement when running on ice, but the return on the effort exerted is not good. &nbsp;As a former runner (dang right knee!), I have experienced the thrill (is there such a thing in running?) of moving on asphalt, rubberized tracks, wooded trails and miles of roadway. &nbsp;My motion is different on those surfaces and I had to make adjustments. &nbsp;Efficiency in running is connected to how smooth and fluid you can make each motion. &nbsp;Movement of arms and legs, head position and breathing are some of the areas to bring together in cohesion for one fluid movement.</p> 
<p>We often don't get to react fluidly. &nbsp;We get to react. &nbsp;Our lives move from being planned by us to being dictated by a thousand other things. &nbsp;Control is needed. &nbsp;Think about your movement.</p> 
<p>I know that there are happenings in life that you cannot plan for - death, injury, care for a parent, etc. - but that's not what I mean by control. &nbsp;Ask some pointed questions of yourself. &nbsp;Can I not participate in this meeting and trust that those involved can handle it without me? &nbsp;Can I delegate more effectively? &nbsp;Do I know the skill sets and aptitudes of my team? &nbsp;How I can free burden from another worker, too? &nbsp;How can we leverage each other better? &nbsp;Examine your environment.</p> 
<p>The staff you are with is dealing with the same. &nbsp;Perhaps working through efficient use of time with managers would be helpful. &nbsp;They, then, can take that training back to their departments and teams. &nbsp;Leveraging time well will lead to an increase in productivity. &nbsp;But bear in mind that if most of us deal with a difficulty in managing our own time, then how would a manager feel equipped to help others. &nbsp;Let's provide some tools! &nbsp;Not everything ""urgent"" is important. &nbsp;We should teach others that truth.</p> 
<p>Start with you. &nbsp;Sometimes, the summer months allow for a vacation or perhaps a couple of days off. &nbsp;Might I challenge you to use a hour or two of it to work through this perspective? &nbsp;Have you been running on ice? &nbsp;Have you seen a loss of passion? &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;What can you do to approach it differently? &nbsp;Are you moving so much but feeling like your not getting very far or making a lasting difference? &nbsp;Have you allowed yourself to be defined by what you do? &nbsp;The way you view your schedule might shed some light on this.</p> 
<p>As I get ready for another day of 90+ degrees as part of the East Coast heatwave, I kinda like thinking about running on ice. &nbsp;It's a heck of a lot cooler than running on the black top of the roadways around Philadelphia. &nbsp;However, those runs really allow me to think clearer about my goals and whether the life I live daily are moving me towards them. &nbsp;If that breakaway would be helpful for you, then grab an ice cube and some water and get moving!</p>","https://21594889.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21594889/Imported_Blog_Media/ice-cubes.jpg","","PUBLISHED","false"

<!--more--><p>As a kid growing up in the 1970's in Philadelphia, I had heard the word used often. &nbsp;I also heard lots of other words used - the F-word for a homosexual male, the C-word for a person from Asian descent, the S-word for a person of Hispanic descent, and more. &nbsp;And if you don't know what words I am referring to, good for you! &nbsp;The culture of the city at that time was very segregated with Italians living in one area of the city, the Irish in another, the Germans in another, etc. &nbsp;While it was great for heritage-related pride, it was devastating for human respect and appreciation.</p> 
<p>So, am I scarred from it? &nbsp;I don't think so (I'll check with my counselor). &nbsp;But, the memories of it came back while listening to the countless ""experts"" banter on about Paula Deen. &nbsp;Now while I don't know all of the details of the deposition, I am to understand that she was questioned regarding if she had ever used a derogatory term to refer to someone of color. &nbsp;She answered honestly and said yes.</p> 
<p>My first thoughts were, ""Man, I would be guilty, too."" &nbsp;Not about using the epithet that she used, but of using other derogatory and hurtful language towards someone that looked different than me or acted differently than I did. &nbsp;You see, I was immature. &nbsp;I thought that my words could fight for me and win. &nbsp;Being a teenager is not an excuse. &nbsp;I did know better.</p> 
<p>The second thoughts I had were surrounding us in HR. &nbsp;What if someone who struggled with race or ethnic relations observed how the masses reacted to Paula Deen. &nbsp;Would it be likely for that person to now walk into work and seek forgiveness and help? &nbsp;Not likely. &nbsp;The honest dialogue that we so desperately try to nurture is in danger of being cut off at the knees. &nbsp;Here is a woman of notoriety who answered honestly in regards to a race-related question. &nbsp;She has apologized for her wrong from years back and has sought forgiveness. &nbsp;She has lost her show, sponsorships and endorsements, and the respect of many people. &nbsp;Not exactly the way to get honest dialogue and healing to happen.</p> 
<p>Please understand that this is not about defending Paula Deen. &nbsp;I don't know her; I've never met her. &nbsp;I don't own any cookware or even a cookbook from her. &nbsp;This is about what kind of dialogue we get to influence at work. &nbsp;Do we honestly think that our workplace doesn't contain people who still use derogatory language? &nbsp;Do we truly believe that our teams are full of people who think well of each other and are not influenced by someone's color, sex or sexual preference? &nbsp;We know better.</p> 
<p>We cannot believe that we'll get lucky like this current situation presents again. &nbsp;We have to use this to open up about stereotypes and bigotry. &nbsp;I have worked for companies where both subtle innuendos and glaring language concerning who is and who is not ""like us"" was used. &nbsp;We cannot allow it. &nbsp;We get to set the stage and encourage the dialogue of the performance to be real so that healing and growth can occur.</p> 
<p>Here's a few scabs to pick at: Are managers passing over resumes with names that are too hard to pronounce (code for ""they probably don't speak English"")? &nbsp;Are there executive teams that operate as a boys-only club with women holding superficial executive titles but no real power? &nbsp;Are there manufacturing lines that ""happen"" to allow people of a similar ethnicity to work side by side while keeping them from different pockets of heritage? &nbsp;Too close to home for you? &nbsp;I could go on.</p> 
<p>I worked for a national retailer once where a manager told me that on the distribution floor it was important to keep the ""Koreans from the Chinese.

<p>The dialogue that we must encourage is far-reaching and cannot be allowed to be shut off. &nbsp;The response to Ms. Deen might scare people from opening up and addressing those issues that it must address. &nbsp;Our companies need to be invested in regarding true human relational understanding. &nbsp;We have made strides over the years (no doubt), but this recent incident shows that it is still tender.</p> 
<p>As someone who has experienced first hand the damage that racial stereotyping can do, it is crucial that the dialogue not be stifled by a fear of losing sponsors, or more frightening, a career. &nbsp;We wind up encouraging people to stay silent and not move towards healing and restoration. &nbsp;In HR, we can be advocates for open dialogue and engagement towards healing. &nbsp;Let's talk to people about how things really are. &nbsp;We ought not to hope to just get lucky with our people; we've got to lead our people.</p>","https://21594889.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21594889/Imported_Blog_Media/PaulaDeen2012.jpg","","PUBLISHED","false"

<!--more--><p>While at #shrm13 in Chicago last week, I couldn't help but be bombarded with some more ideas and considerations by the fleet of speakers on hand. &nbsp;So, as someone who looks to culture often to help with any organizational diagnosis I am asked to do, have my thoughts changed or expanded?</p> 
<p>Simply, no, but largely, yes (Uh oh, am I having a moment here?). &nbsp;Company's are to ask themselves a very simple question - What are we going to be about? &nbsp;That is the basic question that has to be asked and answered. &nbsp;Talent is interested in knowing the answer to this question. &nbsp;Interviewing is not just about the company finding out about the candidate, but the reverse as well. &nbsp;The candidate wants to see if you know what your company is all about. &nbsp;Failure happens quickly here.</p> 
<p>Organizations who do not know who they are fall apart. &nbsp;They don't know what initiatives to start and stick with rather than start and know an end to it (it's okay to do this, by the way). &nbsp;Some companies float aimlessly hoping that whatever they throw against the wall will leave a residue of something that works. &nbsp;Culture is now defined. &nbsp;People recognize that their intrinsic worth for the organization is only about ""what can you do for me?""</p> 
<p>Listen, I know that our employees are there to be productive and to increase the profitability of the company as a result. &nbsp;That's not a secret to an employee. &nbsp;However, when it's all that there is, then the culture is established as only being about that. &nbsp;Depth is lost. &nbsp;Knowledge investment and the capitalization of it is not a priority. &nbsp;Organizational attractiveness and vibrancy doesn't exist; the mechanic of the company is all that there is.</p> 
<p>So, again, what do you want to be about? &nbsp;Let me ask this: what difference would it make to your organization if you had employees who were emotionally bought in to the mission of the company? &nbsp;What if they understood that, while their skills are important to the success of the organization, they were to bring their creativity, passion and openness to work everyday? &nbsp;And, what if they knew that the company valued those aspects and would take action in light of them? &nbsp;You see, saying you want an honest dialogue with everyone means very little if nothing ever comes from those discussions.</p> 
<p>I have walked into organizations that encourage open discussion and sharing. &nbsp;After the meeting is held and heads nod in agreement, it's right back to the same old same old. &nbsp;Culture is then defined. &nbsp;The actions of the organization win out every time over pithy slogans in the lobby or a letterhead with the mission statement on it. &nbsp;If I tell my kids I love them but most of what I do sends a different message, then will they believe me?</p> 
<p>Learning new components as to how to deliver messaging around culture or how to consider culture in light of the competitive climate today is fun. &nbsp;I enjoy it. &nbsp;However, it builds upon the foundational question that companies need to ask themselves. &nbsp;When we ask talent to sign on the dotted line of the offer letter, we have to be prepared to honor that commitment in return. &nbsp;It's our duty to establish what we want to be about and to lead our talent accordingly. &nbsp;We are the ones who invisibly sign such a contract.</p> 
<p>The new employee should not be looked at to fix it for the company. &nbsp;""Well, if we hire Jennifer then she will get this all fixed"" is not fair to Jennifer. &nbsp;It's a company with lots of people and decision-makers. &nbsp;We're not spectators. &nbsp;We, too, are signed and sealed to the health of the organization which includes culture definition. &nbsp;If organizations take the time to think deeply and act upon this commitment, I believe that there would be a strengthening of market share and global positioning.</p> 
<p>It's time to deliver on this commitment.</p>","https://21594889.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21594889/Imported_Blog_Media/thumbnail-2.jpg","","PUBLISHED","false"

<!--more--><p>I am very excited to be going to SHRM13 to see her and, hopefully, to sing with her. &nbsp;She doesn't know it yet, but security ought to know that I am planning on singing backup for one song. &nbsp;Please don't escort me back to my seat, Mr. Big Bouncer...it's cool. &nbsp;Right, Kelly? &nbsp;Pretty please?</p> 
<p>I don't think it much matters as to whether it's singing or dancing or typing or preparing reports or selling or litigating, when you find the right fit, it's exhilarating. &nbsp;Finding someplace where you belong is everyone's ideal; we're wired for it. &nbsp;We want to be a part of a community. &nbsp;Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs 3rd Stage is Love/Belonging. &nbsp;We need this engagement level to be met for holistic living and healthy growth.</p> 
<p>If you are looking for a job, don't settle on this point. &nbsp;I know it's easy to say, but I would want to encourage you to find that role that excites, empowers and challenges you. &nbsp;Be vigilant in finding that role. &nbsp;Study companies and look for what they offer employees, not just in compensation or health benefits, but in team-building and in knowledge enrichment. &nbsp;Where can you grow? &nbsp;With whom would you want to grow?</p> 
<p>We would do well to remember that the candidates we're meeting with are trying to find a role. &nbsp;It's been tough for some of them. &nbsp;Some may feel like they've been waiting a lifetime for that one special job. &nbsp;They often try to put their best foot forward and make a great impression.</p> 
<p>In my career, I have a friend, Matt, who has worked for me twice. &nbsp;I am a couple of years older than Matt (stop laughing, Matt) and we were friends prior to him coming to work for me. &nbsp;He wanted to work for a company that would invest in him and encourage him to greatness. &nbsp;Tall order for any company, I know. &nbsp;What Matt decided was based upon the relationship we had. &nbsp;He already felt invested into and knew that he had grown as I had coached him a bit. &nbsp;I knew that he was a hard worker and coachable. &nbsp;When he secured a job at a company I was working for, he was elated. &nbsp;And he did this again when I moved to a different company. &nbsp;We don't work together now, but we still maintain our friendship. &nbsp;He has used those times when he was invested into as a basis for discerning future opportunities.</p> 
<p>Why isn't that the way it is more often? &nbsp;Why can't we encourage that type of desire within our teams? &nbsp;One area of typical failure is onboarding. &nbsp;We don't do a good job, classically. &nbsp;We spend so much time sourcing, screening, interviewing, testing, etc., that by the time we find the right candidate, we are exhausted. &nbsp;""Yay, we are so glad you are here!"" is our first day gush to a new hire. And very quickly, that same day, we check out and hope the person stays in the cubicle for the entire day. &nbsp;That's what we now call a win?</p> 
<p>Honestly, it should be more like Kelly Clarkson's win. &nbsp;We should be enthusiastic about his/her future. &nbsp;We should decide how to market this person to the others he/she will be working with regularly. &nbsp;We should consider the deposits of culture seriously; decide on what we want messaging to be. &nbsp;Leading them on a brisk office tour (just to get it done) is not effective onboarding. &nbsp;Where is the excitement? &nbsp;We, too, as a company should be thrilled to have found the right person!</p> 
<p>I know that we don't always find the right person. &nbsp;I know that as a result, our recruitment has become less fun and more task-oriented. &nbsp;We have relegated the process to filling a role rather than finding the ideal candidate. &nbsp;I know we talk about strategy and culture, but at the end of the day, we often fall back into a ""get 'er done"" mentality. &nbsp;Let's put the brakes on and turn the car around!</p> 
<p>Listen, it's not just about the enthusiasm or emotionality of the onboarding, it's about the stability of the company, the suite of training for the new hires and the organizational commitment language observed and heard. &nbsp;These facets take work and take time, but they will produce a substantial return on investment. &nbsp;Be long-term in your view!</p> 
<p>So, consider how we welcome and introduce new hires. &nbsp;What should they know about the company after being there for one day? &nbsp;One week? &nbsp;One month? Look at that list and decide on how those objectives of learning will be met. &nbsp;And celebrate all the way through those learning opportunities. &nbsp;Make the culture more vibrant and healthier.</p> 
<p>I am not saying to have fireworks fall from the ceiling like they did for Kelly when she won Idol, but maybe a sparkler wouldn't hurt.</p>

 As a baseball fan, it is tough to hear about the professional athletes using PEDs (Performance Enhancing Drugs) to elevate their game.&nbsp; The use of steroids and blood-affecting enhancements is a travesty, not simply because it is illegal and a bad example to kids, but because it also takes away from the true intention behind competition and excellence in performance.&nbsp; It can cause those who are not using PEDs to be seen as less productive or less valuable to the organization.
</div> 
<!--more--><div dir=""ltr""></div> 
<div dir=""ltr"">
 The reality is the PEDs have allowed for some incredible results for some players.&nbsp; In baseball, more home runs have been hit, more bases stolen and more great catches have been made by some good players.&nbsp; Once PED usage is found to be in play, it's hard to know whether they are good players because they use PEDs or because they really are good players.&nbsp; Would those players have had such great performance without the PEDs?&nbsp; It cannot be known for sure.
</div> 
<div dir=""ltr""></div> 
<div dir=""ltr""> 
 <div dir=""ltr"">
  Many teams, at this point, feel like without the usage of PEDs, they would actually be at a disadvantage.&nbsp; Let's say you are a good baseball player in college.&nbsp; Perhaps there is a chance that a major league organization would be interested in you.&nbsp; Maybe you know some of the other players they are also looking at, and some of them are using PEDs.&nbsp; Are you enticed to participate?&nbsp; Wouldn't there be real fear and concern that if you don't, your shot at playing professionally is over?&nbsp; I know we are made to think that there is enough testing going on to prevent this from happening, but the reality is different.&nbsp; Some players are using PEDs.
 </div> 
 <div dir=""ltr""></div> 
 <div dir=""ltr"">
  I would like to suggest usage of PEDs in companies.&nbsp; Not the kind that I just described, but ones that can be just as powerful and as results-oriented.&nbsp; Let's use Performance Enhancing Dialogue. This would not require anything illegal or any physical testing requirements. &nbsp;It would not cause negative press when it's found out that your company uses it. &nbsp;It would not have to be done in dark rooms or in the basement of an athletic training facility.
 </div> 
 <div dir=""ltr""></div> 
 <div dir=""ltr"">
  Using HR PEDs would require, however, time and planning. &nbsp;It would mean considering fully how each person in the organization fits into the whole. &nbsp;Obviously, there is no way that each HR professional can meet with each person, so planning takes on a different approach. &nbsp;Investing in PEDs with management is the key to success. &nbsp;Along with the executive leadership, HR should approach these planned conversations with a view on the past, present and future.
 </div> 
 <div dir=""ltr""></div> 
 <div dir=""ltr"">
  PAST:
 </div> 
 <div dir=""ltr""></div> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Start with where the manager has been</li> 
  <li>Recall those opportunities of struggle and success</li> 
  <li>Congratulate on growth from experiences</li> 
 </ul> 
 <div dir=""ltr"">
  PRESENT:
 </div> 
 <div dir=""ltr""></div> 
 <ul> 
  <li>What is life today like for this person?</li> 
  <li>How does he/she engage with employees?</li> 
  <li>How has this manager been investing in development of his/her employees?</li> 
  <li>How is the impact of his/her leadership measurable?</li> 
  <li>How has this person shown fortitude, commitment, passion?</li> 
 </ul> 
 <div dir=""ltr"">
  FUTURE:
 </div> 
 <div dir=""ltr""></div> 
 <ul> 
  <li>What does this manager see as the future contributions that he/she can make?</li> 
  <li>What does his/her department look like in a few years?</li> 
  <li>What process changes would make engagement more effective?</li> 
  <li>How can this manager invest more into the development of his/her employees?</li> 
 </ul> 
 <div dir=""ltr"">
  Management will be invested into by HR and senior leadership. &nbsp;From this, management now has the example of what to do with his/her team. &nbsp;It becomes a cultural norm and allows for ease of conversation. &nbsp;The employees will know that the company takes what they do seriously.
 </div> 
 <div dir=""ltr""></div> 
 <div dir=""ltr"">
  Importantly, most of the PEDs conversation is not to be from the negative approach - what hasn't worked, what was missed, what isn't being done. &nbsp;Instead, the language is much more ""glass half full."" &nbsp;This isn't because HR lives in some sort of La La Land, but because the investment in people should push them to the positive through the positive. &nbsp;If you have someone where the bulk of the conversations would have to be from the negative, then I would ask why he/she is still with the company anyway?
 </div> 
 <div dir=""ltr""></div> 
 <div dir=""ltr"">
  Clear conversations around performance will enhance performance. &nbsp;Allow the investment in people to be the ""drug"" that drives performance at your organization. &nbsp;Just as athletes on performance enhancing drugs have to keep taking them to remain consistent in performance, so too should the type of PEDs I am talking about be. &nbsp;Consistency in meeting with those managers and senior leadership is vital. &nbsp;It cannot be a yearly review. &nbsp;There is too much time and too much room for poor engagement in a 12-month swing. &nbsp;Be unapologetically vigilant in ensuring PEDs happen.
 </div> 
 <div dir=""ltr""></div> 
 <div dir=""ltr"">
  While it breaks my heart to hear about athletes, especially for me - baseball players, using performance enhancing drugs, I do not feel the same way about the type of ""drug"" we should be giving our players. &nbsp;We should inject encouragement towards goals, affirmation of correct management approach and gratitude for work completed well. &nbsp;Let's push these types of ""drugs"" daily.

They say too much, share too much and expose too much. &nbsp;So, it's a reality movie.</p> 
<!--more--><p>In the recent interviewing I have been doing for a variety of roles, I have found a few elements bubbling throughout which are very much from the movie. &nbsp;Some candidates are sharing too much. &nbsp;I don't mean as far as work-related or skill-related sharing. &nbsp;I mean, telling me about a child's soccer team drama, a parent's goiter issue or a previous employer's unknown legal issues that could be brought to light. &nbsp;Why are you telling me this? &nbsp;I have kids, parents and previous employers, and I guarantee you that I will not be joining you on that path. &nbsp;An employer wants to know what you can do, not the issues you swim in.</p> 
<p>Too harsh? &nbsp;I know there are some reading and thinking, ""Well, I have to use those vignettes to show my personality so cultural fit can be known."" &nbsp;OK, let's say I give you that. &nbsp;Where is the culture where town-league sports politics, parental health abnormalities and threatened extortionistic testimony is upheld? &nbsp;If you find that place, please tell me so I can avoid it at all costs.</p> 
<p>Candidates, be just as planned with the ""personality"" sharing as you are with the skill set sharing. &nbsp;Put thought into what you will share and what you won't share. &nbsp;The passing introductory mention of a love of the Phillies, for example, is fine as you and the interviewer take a seat if the initial conversation allows for it. &nbsp;But don't throw it into the mix between aptitude and knowledge-related questioning. &nbsp;I know that it's public knowledge that I am a Phillies fan. &nbsp;Trying to bring it up forcefully so I can know that while you are floundering in the main questioning won't work with me.</p> 
<p>And yet, I know that there are employers conducting interviews that spend too much time talking about the unrelated rather than the core competencies. &nbsp;We like the ""buddy"" that can fit personality-wise and forget that there is actually a job to do. &nbsp;Again, too harsh? &nbsp;Consider the amount of complaints, lawsuits, and online write-ups from former employees concerning bad conditions, poorly explained job requirements and terrible management. &nbsp;Who hired these people? &nbsp;Someone interviewed them and hired them. &nbsp;Regardless of whether every former employee is right in their post-employment view, initially he/she was hired for a reason. &nbsp;There was something in the candidate that made someone hiring said, ""yes, a fit.""</p> 
<p>The challenge is to be mindful of the talk. &nbsp;What is it that you're talking about in an interview? &nbsp;Why are you talking about it? &nbsp;If you are the employer in the interview, consider this progression:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Ask questions related to the job description and based on the candidate's experience</li> 
 <li>Explain how the role works in the organization</li> 
 <li>Use some behavioral or situational questioning to get a sense of application</li> 
 <li>Allow for questions from the candidate</li> 
</ul> 
<p>I am not trying to be overly-simplified in approach, but this short list might be enough to get an employer started on a right path of interviewing. &nbsp;I would suggest a deeper dive once this progression is more comfortable and used. &nbsp;There are some other techniques and tools to accompany this basic outline.</p> 
<p>I have no doubts that the movie, The Internship, will be hilarious or at least have funny parts (let's be realistic), but in our organizations, we aren't hiring funny necessarily. &nbsp;We're hiring for skill, for knowledge, for abilities, for fit - all of it. &nbsp;The candidate ought to be looked at through the lens of growth - Can this individual make a positive difference in the advancement of our mission and vision? &nbsp;How will he/she do that? &nbsp;How has he/she demonstrated that previously? &nbsp;It's a good flow and perspective to write down and keep in front of you as you interview.</p> 
<p>Hold onto those questions that aren't job-related for another day down the road. &nbsp;Like the company barbecue. &nbsp;Nothing like chowing down on some ribs while asking an employee how his mom's goiter is doing.</p>","https://21594889.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21594889/Imported_Blog_Media/NEjgJv6nRYrznj_1_1.jpg","","PUBLISHED","false"

<!--more--><p>At the workplace, I get to hear about how so-and-so told so-and-so about how such-and-such happened. &nbsp;And from that, the hurt feelings, the anger, the retaliatory talk all began. &nbsp;My opinion is then asked for in how to deal with it and how to make it so these types of incidents don't happen, or at least reduce in number.</p> 
<p>And so, I do some research into the company. &nbsp;I look at how functions and processes flow. &nbsp;I observe managerial interaction. &nbsp;I look at how the executive team engages with all levels of employees. &nbsp;And then I make some recommendations to better align or even fix some issues in process, procedure and/or organization. &nbsp;And while I know those recommendations and action plans are used and appreciated. &nbsp;There's often one item that I don't put on the list because it's too hard to manage.</p> 
<p>We, as a people, struggle to be gracious. &nbsp;I know, I know, we are the most generous country and help more countries than anywhere else. &nbsp;I agree and there's no argument there. &nbsp;We do know, to a degree, how good we have it. &nbsp;However, those interactions are distant. &nbsp;We can text our donation to the Red Cross and not have to engage any further. &nbsp;It only cost us $10.</p> 
<p>Graciousness is seen in action. &nbsp;When it comes to an interaction with a co-worker, do you err on the side of grace in conversation? &nbsp;Perhaps the person you are talking to is a dunderhead (tough word, I know) and it's all you can do not tell him/her so. &nbsp;Count backwards from 10 and stay in the conversation. &nbsp;Think of ways to help rather than tear apart. &nbsp;Think about this: how can I impact this person for good today? If we're all about reacting and being nasty, what will that profit us?</p> 
<p>More time, resources and money are spent on relational problems than any company would care to measure. &nbsp;We should think like a business owner every day. &nbsp;What will I do to make sure this company is moving forward and not mired in time wasting? &nbsp;Extending grace to someone is not over-rated. &nbsp;In fact, quite the opposite. &nbsp;Consider the other person. &nbsp;For as annoying as that person might be, think about what may have happened in that person's life for he/she to be this way. &nbsp;I don't mean this judgmentally, but rather, compassionately.</p> 
<p>If someone who was abused as a child is now defensive in most conversations, it is understandable. &nbsp;If someone who had been stabbed in the back by a co-worker at a previous job keeps his/her guard up and won't engage with the rest of the team as desired, it's understandable. &nbsp;Notice that I am using the word ""understandable"" rather than ""excusable."" &nbsp;There will be reasons for these folks to move beyond the behavior they demonstrate or the language they use in order to contribute effectively in their role, but it's unlikely that those employees will be willing to do so without first being understood.</p> 
<p>We might be too quick to jump on someone for something they say. &nbsp;Please understand, again, that I do not find any inappropriate or conflict-starting verbiage or actions acceptable. &nbsp;What I do know is that I would rather meet this person with grace to understand so that he/she would have the guard down to receive instruction and coaching. &nbsp;I have had to train myself (not that I am a total expert by any means) to not assume the worst in conversations or to have my back up the moment a particular individual talks to me. &nbsp;I realize this may be very tough for some, but it's something to examine.</p> 
<p>Our time is valuable. &nbsp;Our companies are trying to make money every day to keep the doors open and the lights on. &nbsp;When we engage in marginal conflict with another employee, when we don't want to understand someone else, when we think we've arrived and everyone else has the problem, then we jeopardize the health of our company.</p> 
<p>I do feel the need to mention, however, that if you are dealing with a co-worker who is clearly using offensive language or abusive engagement, then you ought to seek out your HR professional for assistance. &nbsp;Something needs to be done about that.</p> 
<p>So, the next time you feel tension coming on due to a co-worker's approach or due to something someone has said, breathe. &nbsp;Count backwards and think big picture. &nbsp;Offer grace and trust in the fact that the likelihood of repair and correction will come as a result of the initial reaction. &nbsp;As Ms. Jackson says, ""Nasty boys (and girls) don't do a thing for me."" &nbsp;Grace allows the attractiveness of relationship to be forged deeper and, in the business community, will allow for better investment of time, money and resources to move beyond the petty.</p>

<!--more--><p>What struck me the first time was how nice and engaged the staff were. &nbsp;Pleasant smiles, helpful directions and exemplary service were delivered across the board. &nbsp;Again, coming from Philly, I wasn't used to that. &nbsp;I mean no disrespect to the City of Brotherly Love, but seriously, most of the ""helpful directions"" given involved one finger and it always pointed up. &nbsp;I could hardly grasp why these people were like this, other than through some sort of powerful Kool-Aid guzzled each day.</p> 
<p>Now that I am a bit smarter about employee development (you see I said, ""bit"", right?), I realize that Disney is strong in culture and in personal ownership development for each employee. &nbsp;The employees really believe that they are delivering a magical day to everyone. &nbsp;Talent is deeply important to the entire Disney experience. &nbsp;Corporate Disney spends money and time to find out how to capitalize every skill in every moment.</p> 
<p>In&nbsp;<u>Investing in People: Financial Impact of Human Resource Initiatives</u>, Cascio and Boudreau (p. 224) use Disney Theme Parks to speak about talent. &nbsp;To the common observer, one of the most important roles is that of Mickey Mouse. &nbsp;Let me warn you that if you read further, I may be destroying a truth for you. &nbsp;There is a person inside of the Mickey Mouse costume; it's not really Mickey (grab a tissue). &nbsp;The demeanor with which Mickey engages with guests is important, but let's think about what Mickey does. &nbsp;He waves, puts his hands to his mouth in a laughing gesture, poses for pictures and walks around certain areas of the park. &nbsp;Mickey has bodyguards who help lead him around; those same people protect him from the throngs of fans and speak on his behalf. &nbsp;There isn't much development happening once the basics of the role are mastered. &nbsp;This role adds value to the experience and thereby, to the overall organization. &nbsp;Think about it, how stinky would it be if Disney World had no Mickey Mouse (yeah, that's right, I said ""stinky"")?</p> 
<p>But consider this: How crucial is the Mickey role to the strategic value of the growth and development of that talent for the organization? &nbsp;Not very. &nbsp;Waving, laughing, posing - doable. &nbsp;In learning, the charting would look much like a plateau curve - quick learning of the role at the beginning and then a sharp, flat leveling off. &nbsp;Let's instead think of pivotal talent.</p> 
<p>Pivotal talent is where the investment in development would produce organizationally significant improvement and value. &nbsp;In the Disney example, think of the street sweeper. &nbsp;This role is multi-faceted. &nbsp;It's not about just sweeping; again, if only that, then the learning would be quick and then flatten out. &nbsp;The process would be demonstrated, measured and affirmed/corrected. &nbsp;The reality is that the sweeper is often asked questions by the guests. &nbsp;""Excuse me, can you tell me which way to Tomorrowland?"" &nbsp;""Can you tell me what time fireworks will happen tonight?"" &nbsp;""What time does the park close?"" &nbsp;Direct guest interaction happens. &nbsp;Street sweepers will even walk guests to the spot they've had trouble finding. &nbsp;The street sweeper role is pivotal to the success of the experience at Disney World (and other Disney properties) and it demonstrates constant development opportunities for this talent.</p> 
<p>The mission of Disney is&nbsp;is to be one of the world's leading producers and providers of entertainment and information. &nbsp;They do this, in one way, by providing exceptional guest experiences. &nbsp;The investment in the development of customer service, knowledge of services and offerings, recommendations for guest experiences and more will come to fruition through street sweepers. &nbsp;This makes this particular portion of talent pivotal for Disney. &nbsp;And yet, Mickey is the star.</p> 
<p>Think about the companies you work for or with. &nbsp;Consider the talent that they have. &nbsp;What roles serve multiple purposes? &nbsp;Is that role pivotal to the continued success of the company? Would investing more in those roles advance the strategy of the organization? &nbsp;It's not about just being the celebrity or the main focus. &nbsp;Do you think that Martha Stewart is pivotal or valuable? &nbsp;Investing more in making Martha Stewart more ""MarthaStewarty"" would be a waste of resources. &nbsp;Instead, in this case, developing that talent that serves to advance the brand and to make differentiation happen should be priority.</p> 
<p>HR professionals can sometimes slip into the star-struck trap and focus more on Mickey Mouse rather than the street sweeper. &nbsp;Measure the value the role brings to the organization. &nbsp;Where would more investment matter? &nbsp;Are the right people in the roles that are pivotal? &nbsp;If not, how do you get them?</p> 
<p>I can't wait to get back to Disney World this year. &nbsp;I am planning on visiting Mickey and the rest of the characters, but I know I will be appreciating the street sweepers much more this time. &nbsp;Mickey may be the star of the show, but the street sweeper makes the guest engagement enjoyable and worry-free. &nbsp;Find the street sweepers in your organization and develop them!</p>","https://21594889.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21594889/Imported_Blog_Media/Mickey_Mouse_svg_.png","","PUBLISHED","false"

<!--more--><p>It seems like many companies love meetings. &nbsp;I have been part of more meetings than I care to recollect. &nbsp;When I was working hard in college (or hardly working, depending on the day), I didn't think that my professional career would be marked by so many meetings. &nbsp;It's not that I mind, really, but I often think about how fruitful these times are.</p> 
<p>When The Cover Girls sing ""Show Me,"" they be-pop the lyrics ""actions speak louder than words."" &nbsp;I know we're familiar with this phrase and we think it's true. &nbsp;We would want our businesses to be measurably action-oriented. &nbsp;We measure ROI on new hires, training programs and marketing strategies. &nbsp;We should. &nbsp;What if we were to measure the ROI on meetings? &nbsp;What would that show our companies?</p> 
<p>If meetings are held just because, then what is it that we are demonstrating? &nbsp;Our ability to sit in a room and drink K-cup coffee? &nbsp;Are all meetings just brainstorming? &nbsp;Complaining? &nbsp;Or are they motivating? &nbsp;Do we leave with a sense of purpose and a direction? &nbsp;Do we leave with actionable items?</p> 
<p>And let's add to the distraction. &nbsp;Now we can have meetings without ever leaving our desks - GoTo Meetings or Skype. &nbsp;They are convenient, no doubt. &nbsp;Productive? &nbsp;Maybe not. &nbsp;How many times have you worked on two or three other things while you are online ""attending"" a meeting? &nbsp;Perhaps the meetings are not productive because you are not totally engaged. &nbsp;Perhaps you're reading this and thinking, ""yes, John, but you don't know how boring the meetings that the CEO holds are."" &nbsp;I guarantee you, I do.</p> 
<p>So, let's think productively. &nbsp;What are some actionable steps that can be taken to improve the ROI on meetings?</p> 
<p>First, train the people who are presenting. &nbsp;Crazy, right? &nbsp;But let me ask you, how many employees have been trained in this? &nbsp;Employees of all levels may be required to present reports, charts, projections or processes. &nbsp;It should not be assumed that all people can naturally hold the attention of a room and can plan accordingly to do so. &nbsp;I have heard well-meaning people say that practice will help them. &nbsp;If you are doing something wrong and keep practicing it, won't that just help you perfect your wrongness?</p> 
<p>Have you seen the Volkswagen commercial with the dad teaching his son to throw a baseball? &nbsp;Click to watch this. &nbsp;It completely proves my point about practicing doing something the wrong way. &nbsp;In the business setting, we would rather complain about someone who gives poor meetings rather than help him/her to know how to get better at it. &nbsp;We seem to forget how valuable our time is and that the meeting is meant to be informatively productive. &nbsp;We should leave the meeting with something practical - a new approach, tools to make a process easier or faster, or a task to complete that will enable other departments to do their jobs better. &nbsp;Poorly equipped people leading meetings are torturous and costly.</p> 
<p>Secondly, decide as to whether a meeting is necessary. &nbsp;Is it really prudent to hold this meeting? &nbsp;Can one meeting be held together with another to reduce time spent away from actually working on the tasks to complete? &nbsp;There is benefit in holding a meeting with three veins of information in one hour than three different meetings of 30 minutes each. &nbsp;Who can make these decisions? &nbsp;Can we encourage that person to consider such a request?</p> 
<p>At the end of the day, the ROI on meetings should show how these meetings connect to the productivity of the company. &nbsp;Can an employee take what's offered in the meeting and see it have an impact on the work he/she does?</p> 
<p>I should also mention something that some of you may be thinking. &nbsp;What about the intangible things a meeting gives - camaraderie, interpersonal relationship development, unity development? &nbsp;I get it. &nbsp;I agree with this actually. &nbsp;My question in return would be: is the camaraderie developed concerning how much time is wasted in having these meetings? &nbsp;Is that what your attendees are rallying around - complaining? &nbsp;If the goal is to join folks together in unity for an eye-rolling summit, then perhaps you've met your objective. &nbsp;I doubt highly, though, that this is what a company is having meetings for.</p> 
<p>As HR professionals, perhaps we should speak into this area. &nbsp;Can we serve as a resource for training for managers, supervisors, C-Suite? &nbsp;Is that too scary? &nbsp;I hope you're able to have an honest conversation with your CEO about how to make meetings better, even if part of the issue is your CEO. &nbsp;Your insight might prove valuable to him/her. &nbsp;I get how risky that is and so I'd advise you to tread lightly. &nbsp;If you can make this a business case showing ROI, then that will help tremendously.</p> 
<p>Time is valuable. &nbsp;Companies want employees to&nbsp;<b>show them</b>&nbsp;results. &nbsp;If at the end of the day, you've attended five to six meetings, that may not be a great day. &nbsp;Haven't you had those days where you say, ""What did I do today?"" &nbsp;I have. &nbsp;I don't like it. &nbsp;I bring value each day to the work I have been asked to do. &nbsp;I don't want my time manipulated or wasted. &nbsp;I like meetings that allow me to do my job better and equip me to achieve. &nbsp;Meetings held just to hold them are dumb.</p>","https://21594889.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21594889/Imported_Blog_Media/meetings.png","","PUBLISHED","false"

<!--more--><p>I trusted them. &nbsp;The deposits they had made in my life had shown me when I could believe them and when they were just joking. &nbsp;Those relationships are great. &nbsp;The differences in trust and relationship in the workplace vary significantly as compared to high school. &nbsp;I think many experts would speak to avoidance of becoming great friends with co-workers as there are too many work-related factors which could stretch and break those relationships. &nbsp;If that occurs, then future work situations would be difficult and awkward. &nbsp;I understand this. &nbsp;An appropriate set of boundaries allows for right communication and expectation for the relationship. &nbsp;When a boss and a subordinate worker become great friends, there is the potential for relational strain, when the boss has to correct or reprimand the employee, or for managerial stagnation, when due to the relationship the boss refrains from engaging with instruction, correction or reprimand, often leading to frustration on the part of the boss.</p> 
<p>And yet, the past five years have seen a variety of books, studies and articles concerning trust in the workplace. &nbsp;These writers and researchers talk about the positive effect of trust and its influence on the productivity of employees. &nbsp;Again, the research is valid and is worth looking at. &nbsp;There is a correlation between trust and success. &nbsp;Where I think the issue lies is in the composition of what trust is.</p> 
<p>As managers and supervisors may attest, very little development is done in regards to relationship building and integration in the workplace. &nbsp;We tend to revert back to what it meant for us to build relationships in high school. &nbsp;We converse with relaxed language, we ""hang out"" with these employees after work, we grab drinks, have a barbecue, play pranks on other employees, etc...We act like we did when we were in high school. &nbsp;Too harsh? &nbsp;Maybe, but time and again, I know I hear about the loose boundaries between senior leadership and employees in the small to medium-sized business sector. &nbsp;Think about how much is spent on sexual harassment, retaliation and hostile work environment cases - some of these cases read like 10th grade drama.</p> 
<p>So what tools will help to guide the correct approach to trust? &nbsp;A few to consider:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Choose a few to trust</li> 
 <li>Provide for open communication to establish the relationship</li> 
 <li>Find one peer to be accountable to</li> 
 <li>Bridge actions and words so that consistency in relationship happens</li> 
</ul> 
<p>The thoughts here are about thinking wisely. &nbsp;It may be easy to start talking to someone to get to know them, but it's quite a different approach to do that while maintaining an approach with boundaries. &nbsp;Some articles talk about open communication in terms of management explaining every situation to employees so that they feel involved. &nbsp;Well, guess what? &nbsp;Sometimes that is a terrible idea. &nbsp;That doesn't mean that you don't trust those employees if you don't tell them everything; it means that there is an appropriate level of communication and should only be shared with the necessary personnel. &nbsp;I understand that some of those articles mean well, but we should not think that our businesses need to be open books. &nbsp;It's inappropriate and it's a different issue than trust; it's wisdom.</p> 
<p>Accountability is another overused term. &nbsp;""Let's make companies accountable"" was a phrase often heard after the banking crisis of a few years ago. &nbsp;What does that mean? &nbsp;Is accountability telling everyone everything? &nbsp;No. &nbsp;It is finding one or two that you can brainstorm with, share difficulties, express concern over your skill set, ask for advice; it's not something to be done with everyone. &nbsp;Some of the best leaders of some of the most successful companies had people in their trust circles like this. &nbsp;They could tell them how badly they had screwed up and then be willing to report back to this person how they've made changes or corrections. &nbsp;Accountability folks are in your corner, but they also will not just let you be wrong and get away with it. &nbsp;They hold you to a high standard and want to see you succeed.</p> 
<p>Consistency is a beautiful thing. &nbsp;Employees will enjoy consistency in word and deed, to the point of deep trust and loyalty. &nbsp;They will appreciate knowing where the ""true north"" is by watching the deeds and listening to the message of a consistent leadership. &nbsp;There is an air of integrity connected to this message and employees appreciate it.</p> 
<p>Many of these points are not what typically describe high school relationships. &nbsp;We were inconsistent gossipers with only our own self-interests to preserve. &nbsp;And when we did want to go deep, we were too deep. &nbsp;We would tell friends we'd die for them, when we knew we never would, or we'd tell people we'd never tell their secret, when we knew full well that we couldn't wait for next period to tell a few. &nbsp;Very self-serving.</p> 
<p>Our corporate leadership ought not to engage in the same manner. &nbsp;A company needs to have employees who can trust in their leadership, their company. &nbsp;It is a big responsibility, but it's one that can be managed well and appropriately. &nbsp;When companies do act in a manner that is self-serving to the leadership or to a few, it's divisive and leads to poor productivity and higher turnover - signs that trust is out of kilter in the organization.</p> 
<p>So let's leave our high school relationship building behind, along with leggings, over-sized shirts that say, ""Relax,"" polo shirts with the collars up (although, I still love this) and our raspberry berets. &nbsp;Gotta love Prince.</p>","https://21594889.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21594889/Imported_Blog_Media/tumblr_ls23cvxQFP1r0ztfzo1_500.jpg","","PUBLISHED","false"

<!--more--><p>I love that. &nbsp;I love to hear business owners see a bigger picture for their companies as it relates to their people. &nbsp;His words were not trite or trendy; they were passionate and heart-felt.</p> 
<p>A sense of belonging and pride is not easy to cultivate. &nbsp;Think of what it means to have employees really want to ""own"" where they work. &nbsp;Don't start with the glass is half-empty - We understand that the reality is they don't own it. &nbsp;You start by investing in clear expectations and the competencies needed to perform well. &nbsp;The time spent on this helps each employee to know that what he/she brings to the table is valued and focused. &nbsp;It is time-intensive if you've not done it before, but those efforts will come back to the company exponentially.</p> 
<p>Create job descriptions that make sense and work to the business bottom-line - from administrative assistant to line manager to CEO. &nbsp;Design and share expectations and allow performance to be measured against it. &nbsp;You will enable your employees to be proud of their accomplishments when you allow them to know what their focus is.</p> 
<p>Companies put in huge initiatives to create this environment and it falls flat. &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;Because they do it in a vacuum and clinically. &nbsp;A company's personnel are not a lab experiment. &nbsp;Creating expectations and setting goals separately from engaging with current employees will only create policy not culture. &nbsp;There are employees that can talk to you about the heartbeat of a company and what really drives performance. &nbsp;This is not the same as just taking their input and creating a job description from it, but that perspective ought to influence the process.</p> 
<p>When this business owner and I walked into one of the restaurants he owns, the staff was happy to see him and to engage with him. &nbsp;His tone and demeanor through the years helped to cultivate this reaction. &nbsp;Bear in mind that the company owns restaurants across the country. &nbsp;It is not that he's in charge of one place or only has one place. &nbsp;He and his team take the time to know their people and to set them up to succeed in the roles they have. &nbsp;Every manager gets it, every server gets it, every bartender gets it, every host gets it, every busser gets it.</p> 
<p>But this leads us to the second step: cultivating this to understand its scalability as growth occurs. &nbsp;Another 150 employees are about to find out about this wonderful world, but how can that culture be developed with such expansion and more to come? &nbsp;The way to work in creating such an attitude of positive efforts given and appreciated is to continue to pour into a few. &nbsp;Work with those senior managers who then can work with those managers who can then work with their staff. &nbsp;They will tell two friends and so on and so on....</p> 
<p>Granular, grassroots has validity as long as it's couched in behind the scenes process. &nbsp;The alignment of those job competencies along with strategies for effective communication to build up and push success is the ideal marriage. &nbsp;And it can be done.</p> 
<p>However, it takes commitment, work and time. &nbsp;I know, annoying, right? &nbsp;Unfortunately, there is not a way around it if you want true success. &nbsp;Again, throwing an initiative or software at this will not make it happen, and honestly, it will just perpetuate the disconnect that some business leaders see in HR. &nbsp;There they go again, developing programs that require training and time with no results. &nbsp;We would want to serve as the support structure to such an initiative, but we would need drivers like the business leader I've mentioned here.</p> 
<p>The rock is the C-Suite. &nbsp;They know what their expectations are; they know what the profitability needs to look like. &nbsp;If those folks could know that creating such an atmosphere would meet those objectives, then you can bet they'll be cheerleaders for it. &nbsp;They will gladly show corporate-love to all. &nbsp;So, how can you help? &nbsp;Bring some metrics to the table and show how increased cultural ownership creates positivity in attitude and in results. &nbsp;Employees will be proud of what they've accomplished and seek ways to cultivate more.</p> 
<p>One final thought - this is not hearts and flowers. &nbsp;It's not about walking into the office ""loving"" everyone and holding hands while you recite the mission of the company. &nbsp;The truth of the average worker's tenure today is about 4 years before he/she leaves to find another job. &nbsp;And while we can talk about retention another day, what we should decide is the get the maximum out of each employee as he/she was hired to do for as long as we have that employee. &nbsp;Results, baby!</p>","https://21594889.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21594889/Imported_Blog_Media/busy-resto.jpg","","PUBLISHED","false"

<!--more--><div></div> 
<div>
 I was not trained on how to do it. &nbsp;I was not encouraged to check my feelings at the door. &nbsp;I was not given a trajectory to follow. &nbsp;I just marched into the conversation saddled with my attitude and my righteous conviction. &nbsp;Honestly, it was lots more about bravado for me than it was about using this as an opportunity to teach.
</div> 
<div></div> 
<div>
 While the reality is that there are some roles that have high turnover and replacing employees is standard protocol, does that mean the individual is replaceable or just the role? &nbsp;I can hire someone to fill the role of telemarketer, for example, but can I find another ""Joe"" to be that telemarketer? &nbsp;Maybe not. &nbsp;Maybe I should be happy that Joe is out the door and I don't want anyone like him in the building again. &nbsp;Perhaps.
</div> 
<div></div> 
<div>
 One of my professional credos is to leave a place better then when I got there. &nbsp;There are many arenas to do this in, but an exit strategy for terminating employees? &nbsp;I had not given it any thought as to how to leave employees better than when they got there until later in my career. &nbsp;Think about those last words you share with this employee, even in difficulty. &nbsp;Can't a deposit for his/her betterment be made? &nbsp;This is not about being altruistic or sugar-coated, but rather a collective effort to improve the workforce.
</div> 
<div></div> 
<div> 
 <div>
  Not every firing will turn into Jerry Maguire. &nbsp;You know, good-looking, self-centered sales person fired in a public place so as not to make a scene, who then finds beautiful woman who believes in him, and he finally realizes how much he needs others in order to be truly successful. &nbsp;Let's count on one hand how many times that really happens. &nbsp;Most encounters just end a business relationship. &nbsp;""Joe, as you know, you've not met our standards. &nbsp;We've talked about this before and unfortunately, we have to let you go. &nbsp;Today is your last day. &nbsp;Please get your things."" &nbsp;The facts may be true, but where is the take-away.
 </div> 
 <div></div> 
 <div>
  With litigation and fear gripping companies, we are afraid to say more. &nbsp;If the employee has not met standards and he/she knows about it, then bringing it up should not be a surprise. &nbsp;""Joe, as you know you've not met our standards. &nbsp;Here at ACME Company, we expect 250 calls to be made per day and you average only 150 calls. &nbsp;To be successful in this role, those calls are necessary for you to make."" &nbsp;Feedback along with the termination gives the employee something to walk away with and consider. &nbsp;""If I'd have made those calls, this termination might not have happened. &nbsp;Why couldn't I make those calls?""
 </div> 
 <div></div> 
 <div>
  Now, listen all you nay-sayers, I get it. &nbsp;What if the person doesn't have that conversation in his/her head? &nbsp;My answer is simple - that's not your problem. &nbsp;If a terminated employee cannot take the time to be introspective as he/she pursues a new position, then there is nothing you can do about it and it's likely to be repeated in the next role. &nbsp;What I am suggesting is offering the feedback clearly.
 </div> 
 <div></div> 
 <div>
  I understand that roles can be filled, sometimes easily, but we should do what we can, even in small parts, to encourage people to not see themselves as easily replaceable. &nbsp;Each person has value and needs to focus in on the competencies he/she possesses.
 </div> 
 <div></div> 
 <div>
  Beyonce sings ""go ahead and get gone"" in this blog's title song, but there are parts of the song where feedback is given. &nbsp;While I would welcome the opportunity to be Beyonce's new man (don't worry - she's not asking), the fact is that she has someone she feels fits the role of life partner. &nbsp;I'm sure there were others who tried, but if she sang ""Irreplaceable"" to them, I gotta believe they had lots to mull over and perhaps they are better husbands/boyfriends now.

<!--more--><p>In some ways, I'm a bit old school. &nbsp;I believe in hard work for great results. &nbsp;I believe in an honest day's wages for an honest day's work. &nbsp;I believe no one owes you anything. &nbsp;Most of this perspective comes from my family. &nbsp;I was raised with a work ethic that was without excuse. &nbsp;My dad was out of work for over a year in the mid to late 70's and he tried to find a job in his field while he was remodeling kitchens and hanging Sheetrock/drywall on the side. &nbsp;He worked weekends and evenings. &nbsp;He knew he had a family to provide for and that was his mission. &nbsp;He wasn't too proud to lift a phone, a frying pan, a hammer.</p> 
<p>Now, I understand that nostalgia is just that. &nbsp;It's a sentimental remembrance of a time gone by. &nbsp;Time moves on and things change. &nbsp;I know that there are numerous people in an unemployment line today that feel that same passion to provide. &nbsp;I am heartbroken for the families that are struggling today and searching diligently for work. &nbsp;What I, also, know is that each week, I hear from a different person who brings up the feel of the workplace today and the air of entitlement that is pervasive throughout. &nbsp;Nostalgia aside, somewhere we've lost drive.</p> 
<p>Where did it go? &nbsp;Are we lazier? &nbsp;More tired? &nbsp;Stretched too thin? &nbsp;Burned out? &nbsp;Disenfranchised? &nbsp;No longer hungry? &nbsp;You tell me. &nbsp;I have read the ""experts""; I have read books by some smart people. &nbsp;I have read countless blogs telling me what's wrong. &nbsp;So what do we do? &nbsp;I am practical in my business sense. &nbsp;In human resources, I don't believe in programs for programs-sake. &nbsp;Everything that HR does should point to the business bottom line. &nbsp;If it doesn't, then stop it. &nbsp;Time and resources are too precious. &nbsp;We've got to create an action plan to get motivated and get working again.</p> 
<p>As some of you have learned, you can only control what you can control. &nbsp;I didn't learn that from a fortune cookie (although, I should look into starting a business making them...side note!). &nbsp;I learned this from experience. &nbsp;When I was in my 20's, I was going to change the world. &nbsp;In my 30's, the world crapped on me. &nbsp;And now in my 40's (man, that's still hard to write), I have become laser-focused in the ways I can make change happen. &nbsp;I do have control over behaviors and actions; I don't have control over the world or all of life. &nbsp;The action plan we can create to conquer should be based on behavioral and attitudinal change along with clarity in mission.</p> 
<p>We should be on a mission to get back to hard work. &nbsp;The turn-around is not going to be easy. &nbsp;We are living in a country that is falling down the list as measured against other countries. &nbsp;We're 12th in GDP, 6th in innovation and technology and 7th in overall global competitiveness&nbsp;<a href=""http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GlobalCompetitivenessReport_2012-13.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GlobalCompetitivenessReport_2012-13.pdf</a>. &nbsp;(And if you're in HR and you don't know what some of these measurements or terms are, then you had better get an education quickly.) &nbsp;It was not that long ago that the US was 1st in everything. &nbsp;To lose this much ground is unsettling and it should cause us to want to roll up our sleeves and work hard.</p> 
<p>We're in a war for talent. &nbsp;Yahoo is implementing the changes to flexible staffing and schedules because they want to know that the talent they are investing in is returning a profit for the company. &nbsp;Measurement is telling them otherwise, hence the changes. &nbsp;I would argue, though, that we're not in a war for talent...we're in a war for GREAT talent. &nbsp;The pool of people who really fit the bill for what an employer is looking for has shrunk. Companies wind up settling in hiring because they just cannot find the superstars needed.</p> 
<p>Some of this can be remedied by expectation from the employer. &nbsp;Not everyone can be the verbose sales manager that wins over a room with his/her personality and charisma. &nbsp;Not having those traits does not make someone a less desirable candidate. &nbsp;Can you imagine an office full of Michael Scotts or Chris Varicks or Joe Isuzus? (Google them if you don't know). &nbsp;It would be way too much. &nbsp;Superstars run the gamut of personality and approach, but can still produce results. &nbsp;Dig deeper in interviews; be situational and behavioral in questioning. &nbsp;This is where the work should happen in bringing the right people on board.</p> 
<p>Another part of this can be remedied by each and everyone of us. &nbsp;We've got to work harder. &nbsp;I'm serious. &nbsp;There are millions of us who've been infected with the entitlement bug. &nbsp;Take some antibiotics and move on. &nbsp;We deserve what we really work for. &nbsp;One of my favorite business biographies is about Hershey's. Milton Hershey failed seven times in business creation and went bankrupt a couple of times. &nbsp;And yet, he awoke each day determined to make what he knew would work. &nbsp;He refined candy making processes, he sought out better ingredients and he went door to door and in every venue he could to showcase his results. &nbsp;He worked hard for his success.</p> 
<p>I know that there are some of you reading this who are already traveling this road and have this perspective. &nbsp;I see the work you do and I know the results are measurable and real. &nbsp;Allow me to say ""Bravo"" for not only your work, but for your example to others. &nbsp;You are most appreciated and very much needed in our businesses.</p> 
<p>For those who will take the time to reflect on this, perhaps it will inspire you to take some action steps. &nbsp;Have you gotten a bit lazy in your work ethic? &nbsp;Is there an entitlement issue at the core? &nbsp;Identify, create a remedy process and seek out accountability in a trusted business friend. &nbsp;Hold yourself to the highest standard you can; forget about what everyone else is doing or isn't doing.</p> 
<p>I believe in working hard. &nbsp;We work hard to earn a decent living. &nbsp;We work hard to set an example for future generations so they'll know what it takes to maintain and surpass. &nbsp;We work hard to influence societal greatness. &nbsp;We have done it and we can work to do it again.</p>

<!--more--><p>While I was not that kid, I was a captain at times. &nbsp;When I could pick Richie (that kid), I knew we would win. &nbsp;Nothing like a bunch of boys in Catholic school uniforms playing handball in the schoolyard or stickball on the street. &nbsp;Nostalgic, yes, but a lesson in fighting for talent.</p> 
<p>Workforce planning is a wonderful exercise and one that can help an organization chart out its future needs. &nbsp;Being strategic in cost management and production output helps greatly in an organization's competitive advantage. &nbsp;That company can operate leaner and meaner. &nbsp;Perhaps you've gone through the exercise of developing a workforce plan for one of your business units or departments. &nbsp;Deciding on a strategy to meet those future needs leads to a few conclusions.</p> 
<p>My colleagues at DoubleStar do a nice job with outlining strategies. &nbsp;Perhaps it's time to GROW internal staff through training and/or development to close the gap that future needs will certainly show. &nbsp;Perhaps, instead, it might make more sense to BORROW workers through contractors or outsourced means. &nbsp;Maybe it's abundantly evident that the future needs for the workforce can only be met by EMPLOYING external candidates to bring much needed competencies into the organization. &nbsp;Rarely done, but still an option, is to PARTNER with other companies in sharing talent resources. &nbsp;And the least popular strategy, but one that sometimes needs to happen, is to REDUCE the workforce in light of a business reduction or process improvement that will cause fewer workers to be needed.</p> 
<p>These strategies will prove effective. &nbsp;However, they will only prove to be when a thorough analysis of the business and its current workforce is done. &nbsp;Throwing these terms around with your executive is not a great idea if you cannot deliver what they mean. &nbsp;Be mindful of your approach.</p> 
<p>Lest you think I have forgotten about ""Richie,"" I have not. &nbsp;What does your organization do with a ""Richie"" that lands on your doorstep? &nbsp;Do you take a look at his/her credentials, KSA's, work history and then say, ""Sorry, we don't have anything open right now, but I will keep your resume on file""? &nbsp;If he/she is a superstar, will your organization really let him/her walk out the door? &nbsp;Sadly, for many companies, the answer is yes.</p> 
<p>Workforce planning is just that. &nbsp;It's planning. &nbsp;It's being responsible with the talent you have in front of you and with what you reasonably think will be needed over the next three years or so (maybe five years). &nbsp;What you cannot plan for is the ace who walks in your front door. &nbsp;This one person can change the course that some of the workforce plans were based upon. &nbsp;So the question is not ""do we have an opening?"" but rather ""where can I put this person today?"" &nbsp;This person may just be the one that's needed to open up new doors of business, to develop a new process for improvement, or to invent a new product/service for deployment into the markets.</p> 
<p>Think of it this way, I am a huge Phillies fan. &nbsp;Kyle Lohse is not a Phillie, but if for some reason he showed up on Ruben Amaro's doorstep looking for a job, the Phillies would be foolish not to make it work. &nbsp;I know there are salary issues that would have to addressed, rotation schedules to be changed and plans to be revamped. &nbsp;So what? &nbsp;The Phillies organization, like any other organization, would have to evolve and re-calibrate to chart the course to win. &nbsp;Isn't that what we are supposed to encourage in our companies?</p> 
<p>Don't hold onto those workforce plans like they are infallible and unchangeable. &nbsp;They are a chart based upon information from today. &nbsp;If tomorrow, a ""Richie"" curve ball is thrown into the mix, then adjust. &nbsp;Don't deny this talent a place in your organization. &nbsp;Many years ago, I worked for a company that told me, ""John, if you interview someone that you think is amazing and brings strength to our team, then let's find a place for that person."" &nbsp;That's a superb order. &nbsp;We should fight to bring that kind of talent in when we can.</p> 
<p>As I shared, when Richie was picked first, it was a guarantee that the team he was on would win. &nbsp;The opposing team would just grit their teeth and play through their frustration. &nbsp;They made plans for new ways to attack the situation and moved people around until the best use of talent was happening. &nbsp;The other team adjusted to the situation. &nbsp;And because of that, they were more open. &nbsp;So when a new kid, Dave, came to the school, that team was more willing to have him join them. &nbsp;They were open and eager to see how he could fit in to help them win. &nbsp;And on that day, they did. &nbsp;Dave was as good as Richie.</p>","https://21594889.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21594889/Imported_Blog_Media/stkball.jpg","","PUBLISHED","false"

When I was 9, I wanted to be 10. When I was 12, I wanted to be 13. When I was 14, I couldn't wait for 16, then 18, then 21. And then after 21, I realized that death was the next thing to look forward to (Don't even ask me about when I turned 30!).</p> 
<!--more--><p>Those new to the workforce feel a sense of ""wanting to grow up."" They look around and see experience in management and in some of the co-workers on their teams. They are acutely aware of what they don't know and are just as aware that there are even some things that they don't know they don't know (follow me?). I respect this. I am giddy with excitement at the future they will experience. I often express my eager hope for them and encourage them to enjoy the ride and take everything in. Have fun with it.</p> 
<p>And then, it happens. A manager and an HR professional get together to discuss the learning plan for this new employee. And while I am a big believer in outlining expectations and encouraging learning, I have been known to take issue with the manner in which it's shared. Management and HR want this new employee to know how valuable he/she is. We express our happiness at his/her addition to the team. We smile. And then, our ""engagement"" dialogue begins.</p> 
<p>I have been in the room for some of these learning plan discussions. What is to start out with a simple probe into what this employee has observed so far and where he/she sees some gaps that need to be filled turns into interrogation. ""Vee haff VAYS of making hyu tok!"" hangs over the employee as he/she gropes for some more answers to the thinly veiled question of ""how much don't you know?"" I have felt so badly for these employees that I have stepped in and encouraged a different question to be asked, or in some cases, have all but taken over the strategy meeting.</p> 
<p>In a learning plan, the idea is to highlight areas for development and create strategies to engage education, modeling and practice into the plan. What we forget is that everything can't be learned tomorrow. We're so driven by results (which are important!) that we leave little to no room for development. Do you remember Kevin from Home Alone? His parents ""accidentally"" left him home for the Christmas holiday as the whole family headed to France. In their absence, Kevin felt the pressure to learn how to be an adult quickly and was very resourceful in doing so. In one part of the movie, he says, ""I took a shower washing every body part with actual soap; including all my major crevices; including in between my toes and in my belly button, which I never did before but sort of enjoyed. I washed my hair with adult formula shampoo and used cream rinse for that just-washed shine. I can't seem to find my toothbrush, so I'll pick one up when I go out today. Other than that, I'm in good shape."" And as the audience, we laugh because that's funny. &nbsp;Is it so funny at work?</p> 
<p>When our new employees rush to impress because they are already feeling the pressure outlined heavily in our learning plans, they run through a list similar to Kevin's telling of all the great things they've done. They are validating their role, their existence. &nbsp;Sure, some of us would see these employees as brown-nosers or over-achievers, but worse would be labels such as lazy, unmotivated, or in some companies, the worst label of all - Gen Y (don't get me started!). As professionals, we have to consider our presentation of information as much as we consider the information itself. Learning objectives are valuable; continuing or establishing a learning culture is absolutely vital to competitive market strategies and to healthy employee engagement. However, when the delivery of those objectives is done in such a way as to make it ""Hurry up and grow up today,"" pressure builds and insecurities for the employee rise to surface.</p> 
<p>There is a real difference between expressing expectations and overshooting abilities. Some employees in some roles will need to acclimate to parts of their job first. Some roles are tough, some roles are multi-faceted. For some of these employees, this role may be their first real job after college. Don't you remember what it was like transitioning from wearing pajamas/sweats to class everyday to having to really get dressed for work (No? Just me? Awkward).</p> 
<p>I recall one manager of mine who let me grow into the role. He laid out his expectations for me and peppered in often his belief that I would be successful in them. His confidence in me was a driver. His belief that the expectations he gave were things I would conquer, even if I couldn't see it myself at the time, was huge. He did not hand me the list and then heap on the ""you better get this done"" language. He allowed me room to use my personality mixed with my competencies to grow into the role...and to own it. He knew that I would and he didn't need me to get it all solved today.</p> 
<p>Let's be really careful about how quickly we are asking our employees to master their roles. Do an assessment of what some of your most recent conversations were like. Own any language that expressed an overdue amount of pressure and forced maturity in the role, even if was unintentional. Allow those new employees to be guided with expectation, but not made grow up from 21 to 51 overnight. Embrace the talent you have today and encourage the greatness that caused you to hire them in the first place. Let the learning be seen as an everyday practice, not just during ramp up.</p> 
<p>Use language to encourage while being clear in expectations. We want to have our talent set up for success, grow into their roles and be productive. It just shouldn't be forced to happen overnight.</p>","https://21594889.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21594889/Imported_Blog_Media/homealone.jpg","","PUBLISHED","false"

<!--more--><p>When you don't know where you are going, a few key responses kick in. &nbsp;Sometimes you'll get all of them or perhaps just one or two. &nbsp;For starters, fear grips. &nbsp;Fear of mockery by peers who seem to have their lives together and have a path to travel. &nbsp;Fear of another bad move when considering what's next. &nbsp;If judgement displayed didn't send you down a right path, how do you know if you'll decide better next time? &nbsp;Fear of failing in life. &nbsp;The lack of direction is unsettling and causes all sorts of possibilities, usually not good, to travel through your mind.</p> 
<p>And then, get ready for some anger, frustration or numbness to settle in. &nbsp;There will be a reaction.</p> 
<p>Now, think of it collectively. &nbsp;What if your organization has to change direction? &nbsp;What if the path that everyone thought they were to travel down has now been detoured elsewhere? &nbsp;What if employees think that the company's destination is unknown? &nbsp;Over the past five years, many companies did not know where they were going or could be going in light of the economy. &nbsp;Many workers found themselves without direction after some of those companies closed or had a major RIF. &nbsp;Employees who put 15-25 years in an organization left with nothing except fear, panic and guilt.</p> 
<p>Let's think of this as HR professionals (I know, some of us have to put on some major thinking caps for this one). &nbsp;What can we do to display clarity of direction even when, at times, that may be difficult to do?</p> 
<p>First, know the mission. &nbsp;Trite, perhaps. &nbsp;Crucial, always. &nbsp;I still walk into companies and ask the executive team what the corporate mission is, and the times that multiple answers are returned from multiple people is mind-blowing. &nbsp;If the C-suite doesn't show solidarity and consistency in what the goals are or purpose is, then it should come as no shock that employees would be concerned about direction. &nbsp;Be the cheerleader for why everyone is there. &nbsp;If it's to make the best widgets in the world, then get to shouting it from the rooftops. No doubt should live in the mission.</p> 
<p>Secondly, design processes and programs consistent with a message concerning direction. &nbsp;Look back at the training done, the performance reviews completed and the succession plans in place. &nbsp;How much of that dealt with the core mission of the organization? &nbsp;If you find yourself saying, ""well, sort of"" a lot, then that is a problem. &nbsp;There ought to be clearly drawn lines to the main direction of the company. &nbsp;Having great health insurance plans for employees, for example, is great; however, the reason for those plans is not to be nice (sorry to burst bubbles here). &nbsp;The goal is to attract and retain talent that can perform the tasks and functions that need to happen in order for the company to be successful...bottom line. &nbsp;When HR makes it too much about the peripheral and not about the core, we invalidate our business sense and reduce our voice within leadership.</p> 
<p>Third, be bold in advertising the destination points. &nbsp;""Where are we going? &nbsp;Well, right here!"" And then point to where we're going. &nbsp;We hang legally compliant posters at our work locations so we know how to post something for the masses. &nbsp;Why not make some laminated or framed directional and motivational signage? &nbsp;Everyday when employees walk in, they can know why they are there. &nbsp;But, let me be clear, hanging a poster does not drive direction; it should compliment the steps already mentioned. &nbsp;Consistency and repetition is crucial.</p> 
<p>The success of kids' shows is connected to repetition. &nbsp;When my youngest daughter wanted to watch ""Dora the Explorer,"" I would say, ""Sure, Honey!"" but inside I was thinking, ""Oh, dear Lord, no, not again, please."" &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;Because they repeat the same stuff over and over again. &nbsp;I mean, just jump over alligator swamp already...stop telling me ten times that you have to do it, just do it! &nbsp;However, the mental exercise for my child developed her sense of organized thought, understanding plans and belief in the mission at hand. All this and driving her dad nuts (don't even let me get started about ""Elmo's World"").</p> 
<p>I have often heard it said that some workplaces are just like being in high school except everyone has some money. &nbsp;Well, let's work from that concept to start. &nbsp;Consistent delivery (repetition) of message will yield results beneficial to the growth and success of your company. &nbsp;Everyone will know what's expected of them and how it will benefit the entire organization in meeting its goals. &nbsp;They will know the destination.</p> 
<p>When I had to switch majors in college, I didn't have all of the answers. &nbsp;What I did know was that I wanted to make a difference in the world and I wanted to know that my efforts would matter. &nbsp;As I sit with over 20 years of professional experience, I can see the path clearly. &nbsp;I see the impact made and I can see the destination ahead of what's left to be traveled to meet more goals and successes. &nbsp;Start small if you need to. &nbsp;Work with your executive team to outline that consistent message of mission and direction. &nbsp;Challenge the notion that everyone knows it so why bother...you might be surprised at how many aren't working towards it, even if they do know it. &nbsp;I mean, Dora's Map doesn't just tell her where she has to go so that she knows, but rather so that she'll travel that path (see, I learned something, too).</p>

<!--more--><p>I often wonder why we value surface characteristics in our employees. &nbsp;Don't act so outraged! &nbsp;We do. &nbsp;Our culture loves good looks, well-dressed, well-spoken people. &nbsp;Business Insider, along with a number of other articles, reveal statistics about compensation for attractive versus non-attractive people (<a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/attractive-people-are-more-successful-2012-9"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://www.businessinsider.com/attractive-people-are-more-successful-2012-9</a>). &nbsp;Earnings can be up to four times higher for pretty people. &nbsp;Is that just a coincidence? &nbsp;I don't think so. &nbsp;We are the HR professionals that are involved in the hiring process.</p> 
<p>But, even deeper, those pretty people are more likely to advance up the corporate ladder over the unattractive ones. &nbsp;I have not seen nor created succession plans with attractiveness quotients, but somewhere our biases are creeping in. &nbsp;How? &nbsp;Well, what makes something beautiful?</p> 
<p>Herein is the rub. &nbsp;What are the criteria? &nbsp;Nice smile/teeth, wavy hair, strong chin, great figure? &nbsp;Uncomfortable, I know, but somewhere someone is making the decision as to what is pretty. &nbsp;Many moons ago, I worked for a national restaurant chain. &nbsp;I was ""encouraged"" to hire ""the pretty ones"" as hostesses and don't hire guys for those roles. &nbsp;Um, really? &nbsp;By whose criteria is pretty? &nbsp;Mine. &nbsp;No problem. &nbsp;Needless to say there were all kinds of hosts and hostesses hired in those roles...I saw lots of pretty people.</p> 
<p>Often, our interaction with beauty is not as obvious as that example shows. &nbsp;Mostly, it's a psychological affinity to a certain look or feature. &nbsp;It may have no impact on the skills, abilities or knowledge that the employee or candidate has (obviously, if the role is that of a model, then it does!). &nbsp;There is no real performance appraisal box to check on how pretty someone is (but there may be one on hygiene). &nbsp;And yet, again, we're paying pretty people 3-4 times more than average/unattractive people.</p> 
<p>Bias is a tough thing to address internally. &nbsp;Most biases are not egregious. &nbsp;If an employer does not want to hire someone in a protected class because he/she is in a protected class, then that company opens themselves up to lawsuit, penalties and a host of other issues, not to mention how incredibly ridiculous that is. &nbsp;The government has seen to it to address those groups of people that need protection, and rightly so. &nbsp;However, as far as I know, there is no pending legislation concerning the protection of unattractive people. &nbsp;I know that may be shocking, considering the amount of bills under review, but perhaps part of the issue is classifying who is unattractive. &nbsp;I mean, do you want to be the congressperson from ""x"" state to say ""I ain't pretty?"" &nbsp;Those of us who may consider ourselves average or unattractive remain unprotected.</p> 
<p>As HR professionals, we have to be conscious of this. &nbsp;What makes someone beautiful in our organizations? Think of qualities like production, teamwork, leadership, work ethic, loyalty, etc. &nbsp;Aren't they beautiful qualities? &nbsp;Wouldn't you rather have an ""unattractive"" employee that makes a real difference in the productivity and positivity of the organization rather than an ""attractive"" person who brings little excellence to the job? &nbsp;Of course! &nbsp;So, let's be sure that our systems align appropriately.</p> 
<p>I know you may be thinking ""why is he talking about this?"" &nbsp;Well, two reasons. &nbsp;First, upon doing a simple Google search of the topic, I came across at least 10 pages of results with different articles and studies for each page. &nbsp;Wow. &nbsp;And secondly, I like to spend time instructing and coaching college-aged students. &nbsp;Last night, in fact, I had the privilege of presenting to a group from Rowan University. &nbsp;There were so many great ideas and such good energy that it was invigorating to me. &nbsp;After doing some of the research I did in prep for this blog, I thought about companies that might not engage with such bright individuals due to some surface-reaction to attractiveness. &nbsp;Now, I'm not saying that there were unattractive students in that class last night, but rather, I thought about the personal preferences of the hiring managers that will interview these seniors preventing them from being hired.</p> 
<p>It's silly, really, but we are a society obsessed with looks. &nbsp;We value people based on this. &nbsp;Despite the fact that we fight the Miss America pageant and the like, we still tune in to see who wins. &nbsp;We say we don't allow something so superficial as looks to impact business decisions, but the actions show differently. &nbsp;Check your biases. &nbsp;Check the biases in certain departments. &nbsp;Check the cultural biases - beauty, age, sex, clothing, etc. &nbsp;There are real ways that we unintentionally discriminate based on non-skill-related characteristics.</p> 
<p>When I sit with my children, I share with them how beautiful they are. &nbsp;What I make a point to do is to share why I think they're beautiful. &nbsp;I talk about their kindness, compassion, excellence as a student, obedience, friendliness, service...things that will matter in the long run rather than looks which are fleeting. &nbsp;I believe that my children are physically beautiful, too, but that can't be the emphasis. &nbsp;I want them to use their brains, their hands, their feet to be recognized and to show accomplishment, not their looks which did not require much effort on their part (showering is an effort, according to my son).</p> 
<p>We should want our employees to know that the basis for their participation in the success of the company is based on their contributions. &nbsp;We should want them to know that their value is based on real data and impact. &nbsp;We should want them to know that's what makes them beautiful to the company, not their looks. &nbsp;After all, what has Brad Pitt done for your company lately?</p>

"Humareso Blog","Big Time","Big Time – Humareso","en","https://blog.humareso.com/big-time","John Baldino","","""I'm on my way; I'm making it.""  When I finally got a job that paid me enough which allowed me to move out of my grandparents' house and be on my own, it w","2013-02-27 05:00:00","2022-05-26T21:12:01.016Z","<p>""I'm on my way; I'm making it."" &nbsp;When I finally got a job that paid me enough which allowed me to move out of my grandparents' house and be on my own, it was awesome. &nbsp;I was stoked. &nbsp;Honestly, I remember cooking my first meal in my new apartment - pork chops, roasted peppers and tomatoes, brown rice. &nbsp;I took a picture of the plate as I presented it to myself. &nbsp;So silly, but it meant so much to me to fend for myself. &nbsp;I thought I was so ""big time."" I was on my way; I was making it.</p> 
<!--more--><p>I often think about this time in my early 20's when I am recruiting. &nbsp;So many energetic, excited newly graduated to mid-20's candidates applying for an entry level position are dreaming of how much of a difference this position will make for their futures. &nbsp;My heart is so excited for them. &nbsp;They're vim and vigor is palatable, so much so that when someone in that bracket walks in without that vibe, it is noticeable and an absolute put-off.</p> 
<p>What I also appreciate is that same energetic air from the candidates in their 30's, 40's, 50's and 60's. &nbsp;They share the work experiences they've had and the difference it's made in their goals. &nbsp;I listen to accounts of successes and failures, lessons learned and those yet to come. &nbsp;I am energized by their passion for the next chapter of professional development. &nbsp;But again, if someone walks in without that confident approach, it's obvious. &nbsp;Age isn't the issue; it's attitude. &nbsp;I think of Mary Tyler Moore throwing her beret in the air in Minneapolis knowing that she's gonna make it after all. &nbsp;The attack of life is invigorating to those around. &nbsp;Without being trite, it's a beginning, not an ending.</p> 
<p>However, in a time where the recession has eliminated positions, zapped retirement plans and sent many to the unemployment line, it would be easy to have a somber and melancholy attitude settle in. &nbsp;I have witnessed tears and heartbreak by those who've been committed to a company for 25 years only to watch the doors close and the pension along with it. &nbsp;So now, a 58 year-old person is vying for the same job as a 23-year old recent graduate.</p> 
<p>Let's role play for a moment or two. &nbsp;Be both in your mind for a moment.</p> 
<p>You're 58 and you know that you probably won't be making what your last job paid you. &nbsp;You're afraid you don't have the current skills needed to be seen as viable enough for the role. &nbsp;You see iPads and SmartPhones as the tipping point to your qualification rather than the 25 years of experience you possess. &nbsp;You see your competition and you're disheartened that you're sitting in this waiting room.</p> 
<p>You're 23 and you know that you need a job. &nbsp;Mom and Dad have told you that the support lines are done. You are worried that you don't have the skills for this role as you look at the 58 year-old across from you in the waiting room. &nbsp;You grab your iPad and Google ""skills that a 58 year-old has"" so that you can fake it. &nbsp;You're concerned that the manager will look at you as one of those unmotivated, entitled kids that you've come up against for most of the jobs you've interviewed. &nbsp;You see your competition and you're disheartened that you're sitting in this waiting room.</p> 
<p>Got a picture of both? &nbsp;Both of them have a self-fulfilling prophecy behind them. &nbsp;You will be what you decide you'll be. &nbsp;Attitude is a decision of the will. &nbsp;I can choose to be the victim, albeit with a right, or I can choose to rise above it. &nbsp;Listen, this isn't a decision to be Richard Simmons (yeah, I know some of you have ""Sweatin' to the Oldies"" in the back of your DVD collection). &nbsp;It's a decision to be positive and confident in mindset. &nbsp;Your worth as a person is not about the job you do, but rather, the position you have can be reflective of who you are as a person. &nbsp;So, if you're weary and frustrated, stop. &nbsp;Really, stop.</p> 
<p>Why are you in this position? &nbsp;Assess the reasons; own what you need to own. &nbsp;Develop a plan of attack that's tri-purposed. &nbsp;One - address the gaps that you see in what you did in previous roles/address those areas where you lack skills. &nbsp;By address, I don't mean just acknowledge. &nbsp;I mean, acknowledge, confront, seek out learning, develop. &nbsp;It's not okay to say I don't know how to ""x."" &nbsp;Do you know you can search You Tube for guitar playing and learn how to play on your own? &nbsp;Do you know that the internet has lots of information on certain skills and ability-enhancements? &nbsp;What about your community centers and libraries (they do still exist)? &nbsp;Be vigilant in learning.</p> 
<p>Two - volunteer. &nbsp;Use the skills you have and the ones you're developing to give back to others. &nbsp;Engage with youth, seniors, displaced workers, colleges. &nbsp;Develop mastery through usage. &nbsp;Offer to be a resource at whatever level you're able. &nbsp;You'll grow to be more of a resource as you start somewhere in that chain.</p> 
<p>Three - network with attitude. &nbsp;Sending out LinkedIn invites is not networking. &nbsp;Finding communities where you can learn and offer answers at the same time will be more profitable. &nbsp;Be online with purpose. &nbsp;If you're spending a portion of your days playing ""Candy Crush"" or commenting to Ashton Kutchner on Twitter, you're wasting time. &nbsp;Those internet communities matter whether you're 23 or 58. &nbsp;Listen, my aunt is 72 and she smokes me on Facebook know-how and usage. &nbsp;She engages with others, meets people and drives interest in what she brings to the table. &nbsp;She works 3/4 time for a major grocery chain visiting their multi-site operations where she uses her iPhone to tabulate data...hello? &nbsp;She rocks.</p> 
<p>I have often said that if this HR-thing doesn't work out for me (well, it's been 23 years so far, but you never know), I would be happy to pour coffee at Wawa (I'm sorry for those of you who don't know what this is - Google it!). &nbsp;It's not about what I am doing, but how I am doing it. &nbsp;Bills can be paid, yes, but my passions can find a way out even in pouring coffee.</p> 
<p>Let me encourage those of you seeking employment. &nbsp;Change your mindset. &nbsp;There is no reason to be still; there is no reason to be dejected; there is no reason to stop learning. &nbsp;You can use your time wisely and have great impact. &nbsp;Share who you are and what you know how to do. &nbsp;Be open to learning new skills and sharpening others. &nbsp;Walk into interviews with passionate purpose. &nbsp;See your time in life, right now, as an opportunity. &nbsp;Honestly, everyday is a day where we can be on our way. &nbsp;We're all making it.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

"Humareso Blog","I’ll Tumble 4 Ya!","I’ll Tumble 4 Ya! – Humareso","en","https://blog.humareso.com/ill-tumble-4-ya","John Baldino","","When the alarm goes off at 5AM, it's early.  Not that 5AM for me is earlier than it would be for you, but just the simple fact that it's early.  In fact, d","2013-02-20 05:00:00","2022-05-26T21:09:59.325Z","<p>When the alarm goes off at 5AM, it's early. &nbsp;Not that 5AM for me is earlier than it would be for you, but just the simple fact that it's early. &nbsp;In fact, during winter, it's also so dark. &nbsp;I rise with the sun naturally, which is early enough, but to rise in the dark...ugh. &nbsp;So why does my alarm go off at 5AM? &nbsp;To workout. &nbsp;Up and at it, I dress and head over to join the other crazies pumping iron at the gym. &nbsp;I often think, ""What are we doing up? Do we know that lots of other people are sleeping right now?"" &nbsp;But that's the beauty of it. &nbsp;We work out at a less crowded gym and can get all of the facets of our workout done rather easily without waiting for equipment. &nbsp;So, is that motivation enough to get up and do this?</p> 
<!--more--><p>Not really. &nbsp;The decision to do this, for me, is based upon what working out does for me. &nbsp;I am healthier; I have clearer thoughts; I feel better; I have more energy for the day. &nbsp;The effects of working out are really good. &nbsp;But I only get to experience this because I made a decision...a decision that costs me something.</p> 
<p>In HR, we have the ability to be the heartbeat of our companies. &nbsp;We can be that culture-designer. &nbsp;We can set a tone for our teams, our departments. &nbsp;And that starts with the decision to ""set the alarm."" &nbsp;Leadership costs. &nbsp;All great movements cost people something, especially the leaders. &nbsp;Whether it was Jesus, Gandhi, Martin Luther, Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King Jr..costs were counted and accepted. &nbsp;If you study great leadership, you'll see this theme running throughout the lives of those examples.</p> 
<p>Now, I know in HR, we may not have the national or global platform that the persons mentioned did. &nbsp;That's okay. &nbsp;It's not about recognition, but rather, it's about an inspiring influence. &nbsp;We have the privilege of engaging with lots of people that work at our companies. &nbsp;It's no accident that you are in the role you're in. &nbsp;So use that position to breathe new life into the work that needs to be done by changing perspectives. &nbsp;Help your teams have the eyes to see the bigger picture, to see how much the one part of the puzzle he/she does matters, to understand how each part is dependent on the other. &nbsp;Lead people to efficiency, to teamwork...to greatness.</p> 
<p>Many moons ago, I was working for a major retailer. &nbsp;One of the jobs often overlooked was janitorial. &nbsp;Most employees hardly acknowledged the work done to keep the stores clean. &nbsp;I observed a sad janitor emptying trash while two associates were speaking; neither associate even said hello, but neither did the janitor look up to be open to any conversation. &nbsp;I wanted our employees to appreciate this player on the team. &nbsp;I chatted with this janitor about how grateful I was that he was doing what he was doing. &nbsp;I made sure to find him a couple of times a week in whatever department he was in and chatted for a moment with him (so that other employees would see my example). &nbsp;I had a name tag ordered for him. &nbsp;His demeanor began to change and his interaction with other employees occurred. &nbsp;I am not saying that he became ""besties"" with anyone, but I am saying that he was now seen by other employees as a person and not just a function.</p> 
<p>Leadership costs. &nbsp;It takes time. &nbsp;I did not have to use my time to find that janitor. &nbsp;I could have just been willing to chat when it was convenient to me, when I happened upon him. &nbsp;Lasting effects don't work that way. &nbsp;If I only workout when it's convenient...um, hello! No workouts for Johnny! &nbsp;I have to get up early to do it or my day will swallow me, and it won't happen. &nbsp;When you are at work, be deliberate about your schedule but put time in for those relational interactions that help to lead the culture of the organization.</p> 
<p>It's best to start small. &nbsp;Take your time and decide on those initiatives that need leadership. &nbsp;Figure out ways to make it happen for you in the course of your day or week. &nbsp;Just as you might not have much effect if you do something like this once every six weeks, you won't have as much effect if you're trying to change a large component of the company on your first shot at directed leadership. &nbsp;It might not be received well because there's not much, if any, history of your leadership to rely on.</p> 
<p>Let me interject here to say that there is a HUGE difference between managing and leading. &nbsp;You cannot accomplish great change by just managing. &nbsp;Leading is setting a new course, traveling a new road towards a goal, and calling those around you to greatness. &nbsp;Managing, while needed, is not the same thing. &nbsp;Perhaps you've been great at managing the administration of talent or the organization of function...good for you! &nbsp;That has to be done, but that's really just managing well what's already there. &nbsp;Your value as an HR professional in your company is about doing your job well; leadership, I believe, is part of your job.<br> And lastly, though there are other components, it needs direction. &nbsp;Empty leadership is silly. &nbsp;If you are able to truly garner the attention and the buy-in of employees who are willing to go where you lead, and you have no where planned to take them, major fail. &nbsp;Develop a plan, review the goals of it with your CEO or whomever you answer to, work with managers in brainstorming engagement of the plan (get them on board) and make a decision to remain energized and enthusiastic even when it gets a little difficult.</p> 
<p>Again, leadership costs. &nbsp;Everything mentioned here is sacrifice-related. &nbsp;Often, I tell people, ""it's not about you."" &nbsp;So much has been written on servant leadership and the various perspectives on it, so all I will say is that if you are in HR and think that your comfort is why you are in that role, then I would encourage you to find another field. &nbsp;Human capital management is sacrificial in nature. &nbsp;Dealing with, serving and encouraging talent means laying aside, at times, rights that you think you might have. &nbsp;It's not always convenient or pretty, but it's what we get to do.</p> 
<p>What are you willing to do today to get started leading? &nbsp;What do your teams need? &nbsp;How can you bring solution? &nbsp;I know that when I workout, I may not look the prettiest. &nbsp;Old t-shirt, basketball shorts for a guy who can't play basketball, clenched teeth during bench press, a few grunts escape during curls...not pretty. &nbsp;But I am not worried about looking good while doing it; I don't have to. &nbsp;My focus is on the results it gives me. &nbsp;What you can do now might not be the prettiest job to get done, but see that it gets done. Think about how the results will benefit your company.</p> 
<p>Can you lead this initiative? &nbsp;Can you lead it by setting other managers up for success? &nbsp;What might you have to sacrifice? &nbsp;Listen, if Boy George is willing to tumble for you, and he doesn't even know you, then I am sure you can figure out ways to lead those around you in spite of the sacrifices it may mean.</p> 
<p>Count the costs and make a decision for effectiveness in your organizations. &nbsp;Truly, I know that there is greatness among you; act upon it!</p>

<!--more--><p>I have been giving great thought to what we in the HR world fight for in our companies. &nbsp;What we spend our energies on is typically a sign of our passion, of our love, if you will. &nbsp;What we often say we love is strategy. &nbsp;We are HRBP's (you know, business partners); we have a seat at the table (I might lose it if someone uses that phrase at the National SHRM conference this year); we have employee engagement surveys. &nbsp;See how strategic we are!</p> 
<p>Roll your sleeves up. &nbsp;Let's look at our organization as our ""boy"" or ""girl."" &nbsp;We love it. &nbsp;We live for it. &nbsp;We can't bear to be apart from it. &nbsp;Now think strategically. &nbsp;How do we keep it? &nbsp;How do we protect it? &nbsp;How do we fight for it so no one else takes it? &nbsp;That's the driver of strategic business thought. &nbsp;So let's start with one aspect for fun - strategic cost management.</p> 
<p>Strategic cost management is all about analyzing and managing costs so your company can have a competitive advantage. &nbsp;So how do you do that? &nbsp;First off, it takes time. &nbsp;""Date"" the CFO for a while (scary to some, I know). &nbsp;Find out all you can about profit margins and what the break-even point is for the company; better yet, if you don't even know what a break-even analysis is, then ask him/her, or Google it! &nbsp;Find out where the company ranks in terms of efficiency and production standards.</p> 
<p>Another component to start asking yourself has to do with what kind of business you are in the marketplace. Are you a low-cost product distributor? &nbsp;Are you a high-quality, highly individualized customer service kind of experience? &nbsp;These answers are not only part of what will help you develop a strategic cost management plan, but it will influence how you hire, retain and promote. &nbsp;The talent in the company from the entry-level clerk to the CEO has to know what the value proposition is for the company as it competes in the marketplace.</p> 
<p>Think of it this way. &nbsp;If WalMart decided tomorrow it was going to be like Neiman Marcus in its customer experience, it would have to forego its position as a low-cost value giver. &nbsp;It would be near impossible to offer that level of customer engagement and product level and still keep costs as low as we know them to be. &nbsp;If WalMart did that, it would change its business strategy and would have to re-create a cost management structure.</p> 
<p>This ""boyfriend/girlfriend"" of yours can be finicky at times. &nbsp;Fluctuations in the economy, in raw material prices, in the political landscape, etc. all influence the relationship. &nbsp;You might wake up one morning and realize that your love is not what you once knew it to be. &nbsp;Fight to get her/him back. &nbsp;Don't let someone else take the place that your company has. &nbsp;Look at processes and procedures. &nbsp;Are they efficient and effective? Can you develop plans for sustainable advantage? &nbsp;What have been the constants in the relationship? &nbsp;How can they be better leveraged for growth and for stability against competition?</p> 
<p>Let me add a dash of perspective to the mix. &nbsp;I know that you may not be a financial wizard. &nbsp;Some of you reading this might think, ""Listen, I got into HR because I stink at math. &nbsp;I like people and that's it."" &nbsp;I understand that and respect it. &nbsp;So let me meet you in it. &nbsp;If you've ever been passionate about someone, then you know the time you spend with that person is precious to you. &nbsp;You will choose to do things that the object of your affection enjoys just because you want to be with him/her. &nbsp;You learn new things, you think differently, you open your eyes to new views because that's where the other person is. &nbsp;Why can't you put that energy into your role at your company? &nbsp;You love people, okay, but love them by setting them up for success. &nbsp;Love them by putting effort into developing a healthy, long-term environment. &nbsp;Love them by ensuring that the company stays open.</p> 
<p>But remember, love isn't always hearts and flowers as the next day or two might show. &nbsp;Sometimes it means saying no. &nbsp;Sometimes it means compromise. &nbsp;Sometimes it means pruning relationships so that they can grow fuller. &nbsp;When you look at processes as part of the strategic cost management plan, you might realize that money is being wasted in one area. &nbsp;Profits have not been seen in quite some time and the other business units have been covering for it. &nbsp;It might be time to cut it off. &nbsp;Work with your CEO around these issues; it's not a bad thing to promote growth and stability, but it can be painful. &nbsp;A value in strategic cost management has to do with controlling costs and their drivers. &nbsp;If inefficiency or lack of profit potential is found, then it might have to go.</p> 
<p>I understand that this might be tough to take, but that's what passion is about. &nbsp;Running hard after something to attain it and cherish it. &nbsp;Your company needs you to be passionate about its health, its success and its future. &nbsp;Learning the process of cost management and using it to really be strategic for your company is one of the best ways you can show love. &nbsp;Your role within your organization is meant to be people-focused, but that is not to the exclusion of business acumen. &nbsp;That is quite needed for your role! &nbsp;Fight for what you have. &nbsp;Fight to beat out the competition. &nbsp;Fight to keep what your company has achieved. &nbsp;Fight for the future of the company's success. &nbsp;We love a fighter.</p>","","","PUBLISHED","false"
"Humareso Blog","Leave A Tender Moment Alone","Leave A Tender Moment Alone – Humareso","en","https://blog.humareso.com/leave-a-tender-moment-alone","John Baldino","","If you want to learn something about me that is vital to understanding me, it's this: I am obsessed with Billy Joel.  Awkward, yes, but it's mostly because","2013-02-06 05:00:00","2022-05-26T21:08:41.321Z","<p>If you want to learn something about me that is vital to understanding me, it's this: I am obsessed with Billy Joel. &nbsp;Awkward, yes, but it's mostly because of his music. &nbsp;As a kid from South Philly (for those of you unfamiliar, this is the area where Rocky was filmed and takes place), I connect with his blue collar songs of pride, hard work and a good time. &nbsp;However, this particular song throws me for a loop. &nbsp;It's gentle in musical effort, confidently humble in lyric and sung with hubris (I bet you didn't think I was smart enough to write with such vocabulary). &nbsp;Few words and understanding of the moment are valued.</p> 
<!--more--><p>Timing in employee engagement can operate in a similar manner. &nbsp;Sometimes, it's quite nice when few words need to be said. &nbsp;Obviously, I don't mean this romantically; it's a matter of impact. &nbsp;Growing up, my dad would just have to give me the ""look."" &nbsp;Do you know what I mean? &nbsp;If we were somewhere and I was misbehaving, he just shot me the ""look"" with no words or other movement. &nbsp;This look meant ""I will hunt you down once we leave this place. &nbsp;You won't be able to hide. &nbsp;Run, if you dare, but I will catch you and destroy you"" (if you can say that in Liam Neeson's voice, then you've got the idea and the shivers, right?). &nbsp;There are times that no words are needed.</p> 
<p>In Human Resources, we may have grown accustomed to talking. &nbsp;Some of us may have grown accustomed to talking lots. &nbsp;Some of us are unable to shut up long enough to read this post. &nbsp;Listen, I'm serious. &nbsp;Some of us take the constant message-giving role and can't stop it. &nbsp;We don't know how to listen and feel out a situation anymore. &nbsp;To go deeper, some of us have lost jobs because of our know-it-all, share-it-all, disapproving demeanor. &nbsp;Some of my HR colleagues have had their marriages dissolve because they couldn't shut down the policy-laden diatribe; a spouse can only deal with that for so long.</p> 
<p>To be present in the conversation or the engagement means a bit of tenderness sometimes. &nbsp;So what does tenderness mean? &nbsp;Am I to be some sort of mamby-pamby HR cry baby? &nbsp;Tenderness is an art and a skill. &nbsp;It has to be practiced. &nbsp;It does not only exist in a romantic context, but is applicable to the larger relational context. &nbsp;Engagement is tied to being heard and respected; Jim Whitehurst of Red Hat talks about this being a necessary tenant to retention. &nbsp;When employees can exist in a space where mutual communication is encouraged, but there is also an example of that communication being set by management, then the culture is impacted appropriately.</p> 
<p>Sometimes, just because something can be said doesn't mean it should. &nbsp;As an HR professional, I have taken the time to develop managers' ability to read situations. &nbsp;You know, it's like the post-Olympic race interview to the US athlete who's just taken fourth when he/she was expected to win. &nbsp;The interviewer eventually asks those dumb questions: ""Are you disappointed? &nbsp;How are you feeling?"" &nbsp;Seriously, Costas? &nbsp;What do you want the athlete to say? &nbsp;""No, I'm thrilled that I just blew it for our country. &nbsp;I mean, after four years of training constantly, my hope was to pull a fourth place finish."" &nbsp;Leave the tender moment alone. &nbsp;Sometimes you just cry with someone. &nbsp;Sometimes you just shut up and sympathize.</p> 
<p>One of the worst times in my early career was having to deal with an employee who suddenly lost her spouse. &nbsp;There were no signs of issues and he was in his early forties. &nbsp;When she shared what had happened and was requesting time off to handle affairs, I offered my condolences and then launched into a filibuster of poetic nonsense and uneducated counseling. &nbsp;This employee did not need that; she needed me to acknowledge what she was asking for and to just be present for her. &nbsp;Showing silent support can sometimes be the loudest, deepest message.</p> 
<p>But let me also bring this to a less emotional level. &nbsp;If you find that, in any meeting, you are normally the one with the most to say, you are doing something wrong. &nbsp;Your words are ineffective and they leave you seeming foolish to your co-workers. &nbsp;C'mon, you have to know that you are the person that everyone else is rolling their eyes about when you're not looking. &nbsp;You are the one that post-meeting emails are being sent about. &nbsp;You are the one who is diminishing your brilliance by your verbosity. &nbsp;Pay attention to your environment and know when to just let one simple sentence simmer in the room. &nbsp;That can be exceedingly impactful.</p> 
<p>Understand that I share these things to encourage us as HR professionals. &nbsp;I can use where I have failed in my past to point to a better road. &nbsp;I know how hard it is to refrain from sharing everything you know. &nbsp;I know that there is fear that you may never have the chance again if you don't say something now. &nbsp;Seek to be more present by allowing your words to be influential rather than inconsequential due to their overuse. &nbsp;When you engage with employees, listen first and more often than you speak. &nbsp;You work for the company and your responsibility is to your employer, but your finesse in understanding situations and engaging employees is needed for the good of the company.</p> 
<p>Listen, Billy said it best: ""Just when I ought to relax, I put my foot in my mouth."" &nbsp;I have tasted every area of my feet for as much as they've been in my mouth. &nbsp;It's a terrible taste and an even worse consequence to the relationships for which I have been entrusted. &nbsp;You don't need to keep training, advising, correcting, or coaching with words all the time. &nbsp;Understand the moments as they come and breathe. &nbsp;You may find that breathing through them influences a right reaction rather than using all your breath to talk through them.</p>","","","PUBLISHED","false"

<!--more--><p>On a practical matter, I have been privileged enough to bear witness to both sides of the coolness equation for corporate interaction in regards to employee relations and training sessions. &nbsp;I have seen people dress up, dress down, dress in costume, dress in a dress...you get the idea. &nbsp;The dog and pony show gets pulled out when certain topics have to be covered or certain compliance points have to be met. &nbsp;I mean, really? &nbsp;How many times can I watch a video on sexual harassment? &nbsp;Part of me worries that if we have to spend so much time defining it, aren't we losing our audience? I, also, think that if we have employees who don't know what sexual harassment is by now, perhaps we should really consider whether their aptitude is at an appropriate level for the company.</p> 
<p>To combat this, some HR professionals spend more time planning to introduce engagement programs than actually preparing for the meat of the program. &nbsp;We want to be cool. &nbsp;We want the employees to love it. &nbsp;We want the employees to ask for copies of the presentation. &nbsp;We want our egos stroked (ouch!). &nbsp;The Internet is full of stuff for HR folks to use, and unfortunately, as HR professionals, we spend time looking at all of it. &nbsp;Listen, I am all for updating the repertoire (and I will cross that bridge in a moment) but I don't think we should swing the pendulum so far the other way that the latest and greatest is what we look for constantly. &nbsp;There is something to be said about tried and true learning methodologies.</p> 
<p>Engage your employees based on valid and reliable adult learning and adult interaction principles. &nbsp;Having dock workers make balloon animals in an icebreaker exercise to prep for a session on appreciating your co-workers might not be the best idea. &nbsp;Think of the balloons, for Pete's sake! &nbsp;Know the audience; know your employees. &nbsp;If, as HR professionals, we are to relate policy, procedure, mission, and vision to the employees we serve, then shame on us when we use trite, non-thoughtful ways to engage those employees. &nbsp;Aren't we delivering a message that we just don't understand them?</p> 
<p>Take an informal pulse of communications, culture and creativity in the workplace. &nbsp;Set up a few skip-level interviews and allow them to be causal for both the senior executive and the line worker. &nbsp;Get feedback from both or sit in on some of them. &nbsp;You might be amazed at the insight. &nbsp;The needs of the company may actually be different than you had originally thought.</p> 
<p>As promised, however, the other end of the spectrum deserves recognition. &nbsp;I mean, haven't you seen that FISH video enough? &nbsp;Are you still pulling out that tape? &nbsp;First of all, if you've purchased the DVD of it, I can tell you that you've been using it too long - you've had to order the DVD after the original VHS issuance. &nbsp;It's old! &nbsp;Some of the guys in the video have mullets (if you have one, I apologize, but it's time to let it go - Billy Ray did!) &nbsp;Love the message, but those Pike Place fish stink by now. &nbsp;Look for something newer. &nbsp;And don't just do it because new is better, but rather do it because new may be more relevant.</p> 
<p>The messages in some newer product will use language that is more current and the product of more recent research. &nbsp;Old data in a presentation will be a distraction to the audience as they try to figure out what the new info might/should be. &nbsp;It, also, delivers a message that you are just going through the motions, even if you are not. &nbsp;Don't allow aged material to damage your reputation to employees and to senior management. &nbsp;Both groups can think you don't have your finger on the pulse. &nbsp;In 2007, I sat in a meeting where someone shared with the CEO to not worry about social media because it won't be around in a year or two; ""there's no money in it"" is why he said it would be gone. &nbsp;So, as many of you follow me and Humareso on Twitter, Facebook, Google&nbsp;+ and LinkedIn...you get it.</p> 
<p>Relevance is crucial in talent acquisition and in talent engagement. &nbsp;What I am sharing is not just about Gen Y. &nbsp;Model technology usage, model fresh approaches, model competitive market analysis and do so in a way that shows investment of time, talent and resources on your part. &nbsp;The employees we serve are selling and interacting in a culture that is all about those items. &nbsp;Show the executive team how they can be used internally with employees and show employees how they can be used externally with customers.</p> 
<p>I must, however, show love for those HR professionals who are balancing this well. &nbsp;Adult learning, modern business interaction and relevance is an art to manage and combine appropriately. &nbsp;I have been in sessions with some superstars. &nbsp;Part of this week's blog is based on the awesomeness I have seen and the conviction that it can be done well. &nbsp;Employees were inspired and engaged; they left the room ready to tackle their work differently. &nbsp;Many left the room confident in the company they work for, confident in the company's approach in the marketplace and confident that they could contribute to that effort.</p> 
<p>Who says you can't incorporate accurate appropriate adult learning methods for engagement with modern technology? &nbsp;Nobody. &nbsp;Who says you aren't able to invent new modes for your company that show clarity of mission while encouraging updated methodology? &nbsp;Nobody. &nbsp;Who says you can't be cool? &nbsp;Nobody...except your kids.</p>","","","PUBLISHED","false"

Cavaricci's (look it up). &nbsp;A very good friend of mine called me ""Duckie."" &nbsp;I had multiple Swatch watches (OK, I still have them...don't judge me). &nbsp;I loved Molly Ringwald. &nbsp;When the queen of great 80's movies appeared at the end of&nbsp;<u>Pretty in Pink</u>&nbsp;in her prom dress, that she made, while the Psychedelic Furs sang in the background, I fell even deeper in love.</p> 
<!--more--><p>But guess what? &nbsp;That love was futile. &nbsp;It didn't last (plus the restraining order she had against me prevented me from getting within 100 yards of her...but I digress). &nbsp;The truth of the matter is that I was enamored with the facade. &nbsp;There was no substance to our relationship. &nbsp;I didn't really know her and she didn't know me. &nbsp;Our relationship was one-sided; Molly entertained me and I enjoyed it for a bit. &nbsp;Was my life really impacted, other than a bit of nostalgia and a couple of correct answers in Trivial Pursuit? &nbsp;Nah.</p> 
<p>It reminds me of training today. &nbsp;A trainer prepares a session which entertains (maybe) those required to attend. &nbsp;The attendees may enjoy the time out of production; they make like the lunch provided to ""learn"" something; they may nod in approval to a new idea. &nbsp;Yet, what happens after the session? &nbsp;Many times, employees leave and have little opportunity to engage deeper in what they've heard. &nbsp;Substance is difficult to maintain in the training relationship.</p> 
<p>Part of the issue is defining things as training. &nbsp;From the part of the HR forest I live in, training is job-related and skill-related. &nbsp;It is shorter-term in nature and it should have measurable results. &nbsp;Learning a new software process, a new packaging procedure or a new return policy should be able to be handled in a training session. &nbsp;In training, a learner should be able to see quickly and clearly WIIFM - what's in it for me. &nbsp;They should be able to understand how it will make their tasks done quicker, more precisely and more easily.</p> 
<p>For some companies, training is done often. &nbsp;Management training, new hire training, sales training, etc. are all facets that can be done in the manner described. &nbsp;However, what some companies think they have are development programs. &nbsp;Development is long-term. &nbsp;These programs are just that - full programs. &nbsp;For example, investing in people to develop leaders is not a training session once a year or even once per quarter. &nbsp;It is a mindful and intentional commitment to develop specific qualities and perspectives in those deemed able to handle this. &nbsp;As I am brought into a variety of companies, I see much more training going on rather than development, even though they call it development.</p> 
<p>But let me be fair! &nbsp;Many companies don't encourage development because it doesn't help the immediate bottom line. &nbsp;And the bottom line matters. &nbsp;These types of true developmental programs can take a couple of years before significant fruit will be seen. &nbsp;Companies are not that patient, nor can they afford to be. &nbsp;They are not mean, but they cannot be that altruistic. &nbsp;Pepper in what the global economy has been like over the past few years and, like, totally, no way (please read this in your best valley girl inside voice).</p> 
<p>And look at the stats on where our educational training puts us. &nbsp;In the most recent studies, the US school system ranks 25th in Math, 12th in Reading and 20th in Science in the WORLD! (OECD,<a href=""http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0923110.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">&nbsp;http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0923110.html</a>) &nbsp;With those numbers, we've got take a look at what we're modeling based on what we've seen. &nbsp;I am not saying teachers can't teach (believe me, I know some exceptional ones), but there has to be a gap in delivering material to encourage learning rather than to encourage meeting some standard. &nbsp;We have fallen short in challenging people to think critically and analytically which is key to true learning. &nbsp;If this is the first system that those of us who train and develop see, then it stands to reason that we can easily fall into similar patterns in creating educational sessions for our companies.</p> 
<p>Be critical about your delivery methods and the programs created. &nbsp;As HR professionals, we have to be aware of ""flash in the pan"" sessions which may entertain but provide no lasting benefit. &nbsp;If we really are a product, at least in part, of the type of exposure we've been given to teachers and trainers, then make sure you're emulating what works. &nbsp;Seek out those substantive, exceptional trainers and learn from them. &nbsp;Study, practice, study and practice again.</p> 
<p>And don't label something as development when it is really training; it will diminish the punch when you really do have something developmental. &nbsp;Assess whether something is long-term or short-term; determine whether what you want to present is skill needed for the job today or aptitude/ability/attitude-related for down the road.</p> 
<p>We've got to be serious about development and we've got to be serious about training. &nbsp;Both are required, but each is to be approached differently. &nbsp;Measure success in the short-term with training and use that as you meet with the executive team to encourage developmental programs to start. &nbsp;Show them that you have the tools and the results. &nbsp;The C-Suite can also believe that what HR does is just provide touchy-feely sessions and there is no backbone to it; you've got to show them differently.</p> 
<p>In my life, I have spent about 6-8 hours with Molly Ringwald. &nbsp;She presented information that I enjoyed and was necessary for the job I had at the time - to be a teenager. &nbsp;When I watch those ""sessions"" now, I can smile for what once was, but it no longer applies. &nbsp;I have been developed by some significant mentors and through some long-term programs. &nbsp;Molly can't hold a candle to what those investments meant to and for me. &nbsp;Not even if she had sixteen of them.</p>","","","PUBLISHED","false"

<p>My son wants to play baseball professionally. &nbsp;Yeah, I know, get in line. &nbsp;But he's really good. &nbsp;No, really. &nbsp;Wait, did I mention that he pitches, fields and bats both left and right-handed? &nbsp;Ha, now I got your attention. &nbsp;He's really amazing at it. &nbsp;I can hardly write with my left-hand (as a right-handed guy) so to watch him play first base left-handed and then switch to right-handed shortstop in the same inning is crazy (by the way, if any MLB coaches are reading this, yes, we are open to talking salary and Triple A teams now). &nbsp;What also should be known is that he works at it. &nbsp;He is learning how to be better at baseball. &nbsp;He works with baseball trainers and attends clinics. &nbsp;He is motivated to want to know because he sees what it can mean for him (I, also, know what it will mean for my retirement plan!).</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>We know that many employees have to have a willingness to learn. &nbsp;Most realize that if they are to move ahead in an organization, they need to expand their skill set and be open to new veins of interaction. &nbsp;Furthermore, it makes employees more marketable should they desire to move from one organization to another. &nbsp;Being willing to learn shows an employer that team-player attitude. &nbsp;Managers feel that more than half the battle is won when they are dealing with such a positive commitment from an employee. &nbsp;Often, this trait is measured, to some degree, on performance appraisals and used to assess certain succession plans.</p>
<p>What about switching the perspective, though? &nbsp;What about appraising an organization's willingness to learn? &nbsp;Can't an employee expect his/her employer to demonstrate the same level of desire in learning as the employee is supposed to have?</p>
<p>""Strategic growth"" is over-used (even by me...guilty as charged). &nbsp;The intent behind it is to help companies figure out where their paths of improvement and profitability are and where they could be. &nbsp;The problem with the terminology now is that companies tend to think that having a gym in-house counts as their strategic growth initiative. &nbsp;Listen, I'm all for working out (I do it regularly myself, honest!), but that alone is a far cry from what the concept is really meant to be.</p>
<p>When I am privileged to be called in to meet with the executive team, it's often because the company is trying to maintain what it has and figure out how to use it to grow. &nbsp;We have great conversations about competition, innovation, technology, people and marketing. &nbsp;And it's in those conversations that I hear leadership talk about how much ""others"" have to do. &nbsp;""If we could just get employees to do this better"" or ""If we had the money to buy that, things would improve"" might be shared by the executive team. &nbsp;I take my notes physically and mentally.</p>
<p>Companies need to start with what they can control. &nbsp;What do they have right now that can be built upon? &nbsp;Learning this approach helps to clarify mission and vision rather than re-hash wish lists and missed opportunities. &nbsp;You can't get to the level of excellence desired if you're held down by what didn't happen or what can't happen. &nbsp;There is plenty of what can happen today, in the short-term, to focus upon to meet the long-range goals.</p>
<p>I met with a company that wanted me to help them grow by engaging employees at a richer, more inclusive way. &nbsp;The company said it wanted to have employees involved in directing some of the goals of the company to help create buy-in, but also to create collaboration. &nbsp;For years, apparently, employees had complained that the executive team did not understand life on the production line. &nbsp;The company wanted to move forward in a healthier direction, which they believed would increase production and profit. &nbsp;When I had conducted an employee survey, which included the items mentioned, the results were not surprising to me. &nbsp;Employees were very specific about initiatives that they thought would help the company grow. &nbsp;The survey was completed thoughtfully and challenges were expressed; the employees were extending themselves as part of the solution in the initiatives they were suggesting. &nbsp;As I shared the first employee-suggested initiative for growth, the CEO said, ""See, I knew this would happen. &nbsp;They ask too much of us. &nbsp;There's no way we can do that.""</p>
<p>Didn't that CEO ask the employees to share in the collaboration process? &nbsp;What did collaboration mean? &nbsp;Just share things with me that I think the company can do today? &nbsp;Weren't the employees allowed to be free in the brainstorming process? &nbsp;Wasn't part of the goal in including employees to create buy-in? &nbsp;What I left with that day was an understanding that the executive team had much more to learn and work through in order to really see growth, sustained growth, in their organization.</p>
<p>Intentions from a company only go so far (and it's not very far, by the way). &nbsp;A company has to see where it wants to be first. &nbsp;Create that vision board, dream and design a bit. &nbsp;Once you know where you want to go, count the costs. &nbsp;If it didn't cost anything, then all companies would be walking that path already. &nbsp;The executive team needs to make a decision as to how much they are willing to invest - in time, publicity, relationships, training, etc. &nbsp;Effort counts, but only if it's towards something that can be measured. &nbsp;Companies don't make money by feelings (good or bad), but only when the health of an organization produces results in service and profit.</p>
<p>A company can't get to success (there) from the same approach (here). &nbsp;Please know that I am not saying that everything has to be thrown out; if a company has tread water over the past five years, even that is saying something is working. &nbsp;Yet, there are processes, markets, innovation and the like that should be explored for further growth. &nbsp;An organization can learn.</p>
<p>Companies should be ready to learn a new approach. &nbsp;A desire to succeed means action plans that will stretch knowledge and skills. &nbsp;So, get in the game, all you executive teams! &nbsp;A swing and a miss is always better than watching the ball go by.</p>

<!--more--><div></div> 
<div>
 Over the summer, I read some unbelievable statistics. &nbsp;The World Health Organization stated that it costs American businesses $300 billion per year in employee stress-related medical issues, including increased healthcare insurance costs (
 <a href=""http://www.who.int/research/en/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://www.who.int/research/en/</a>). &nbsp;On top of that, USA Today reported that 75% of employees surveyed stated that their immediate boss is the most stressful part of their job (
 <a href=""http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/workplace/story/2012-08-05/apa-mean-bosses/56813062/1"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/workplace/story/2012-08-05/apa-mean-bosses/56813062/1</a>). &nbsp;Ugh! &nbsp;What a horrible indictment of management. &nbsp;How can such a truth not be more addressed in the workplace?
</div> 
<div></div> 
<div>
 But my focus on this is not for the manager, but for the employee. &nbsp;When I was very young in my professional career, I was tasked to create a culture of learning in the organization for which I was working. &nbsp;I studied up on what a learning organization is like, what kinds of strategies should be used to roll that out and surveyed employees to find out how some deficiencies could be addressed. &nbsp;The roll-out was better than I could have hoped, and even better, after 90 days of initial implementation, there were real metrics that showed improvement and cost-effectiveness. &nbsp;I was super-psyched! &nbsp;And that all came crashing down when my direct supervisor caught up with me at the end of a workday to let me know that he did not approve of the style of font used in some of the internal marketing. &nbsp;Excuse me? &nbsp;Did you just say ""font""?
</div> 
<div></div> 
<div>
 Well, needless to say, I was sick. &nbsp;Worse yet, the supervisor documented his comments on my performance review. &nbsp;Now the word ""font"" was on my permanent record. &nbsp;But, to remind you, I was young in my career. &nbsp;I was so stressed by his critical nature that I made myself sick, to the point of contracting mono due to how worn-down I had made myself. &nbsp;So, now, I got to spend three weeks resting and stewing over how much criticism I would receive when I returned to work.
</div> 
<div></div> 
<div>
 So, why do I tell you this? &nbsp;Because of him, I allowed myself to get sick. &nbsp;My employment contract had become my life contract. &nbsp;What it did to me was rob me of professional growth in some areas, but it also robbed me of my life outside of work. &nbsp;I allowed it. &nbsp;I gave power to that manager that he did not deserve. &nbsp;You see, I finally realized that I was to do a great job at work for me. &nbsp;I needed to impress myself first. &nbsp;That manager was allowed to mess with my head, and I let him do it. &nbsp;I allowed font styles to override metrics of success. &nbsp;Opinion overruled fact. &nbsp;And I let it happen.
</div> 
<div></div> 
<div>
 As an employee, there is no denying the need to learn. &nbsp;You've got to know what you don't know and find a way to learn it. &nbsp;Seek out experts, watch the good habits of those who've been at the company for a while, ask a manager for suggestions for improvement, be vigilant in excellence. &nbsp;You have the power to be successful in your role and it can be measured.
</div> 
<div></div> 
<div>
 A Human Resources professional can work with management and their teams to enjoin appropriate expectations to output. &nbsp;The HR manager can help employees understand how their work ethic and effort should align to corporate mission. &nbsp;Management can be trained in developing performance indicators to share with their team. &nbsp;These tools will help to balance preference with data.
</div> 
<div></div> 
<div>
 Opinion does matter and it should be given some consideration. You do want to perform well and meet expectations, but be sure to know how much of it is to meet someone's esteem issues or fear. &nbsp;The manager I described was threatened by the success. &nbsp;A 22 year-old kid should not have had such a winning roll-out, but I did. &nbsp;My manager was not ready for that, but it didn't change the truth of what had happened.
</div> 
<div></div> 
<div>
 For those of you struggling with your managers, take a step back and figure out why. &nbsp;Is the answer as simple as ""well, he's a jerk"" or something similar? &nbsp;Even if he/she is a jerk, what does that do to you? &nbsp;Can you really not do your job because of it? &nbsp;Couldn't the people in the organization I was with still be set up for success in learning even though my manager was a jerk? &nbsp;You bet. &nbsp;My job was to do a great job. &nbsp;I had to answer to myself first for the work I was doing.
</div> 
<div></div> 
<div>
 And in my experience, when you answer to you first (not only), you will meet, if not surpass, the expectations of management. &nbsp;Then, those who've benefited from your work will share their success with you. &nbsp;And they might even tell you it happened because of you.

 They need to be diligent and focused. &nbsp;They need to remain positive when it's tough to do so. &nbsp;They need to be able to handle change well and be productive in every situation, whether good or bad. &nbsp;Attitude is crucial and skills need to be varied and high. &nbsp;This manager has to believe in what he or she is leading, not just managing.
</div> 
<div></div> 
<div>
 The one component that they cannot manufacture is the employee. &nbsp;There need to be employees who are eager to work, to excel and to learn. &nbsp;Sounds easy, right? &nbsp;Towers Watson has recently done a study showing that almost two-thirds of employees are not fully engaged in their work. &nbsp;A big part of the reasoning behind these results has to do with those employees surveyed doing more with less. &nbsp;The five to ten year old theme of having employees ""multi-task"" has gotten old. &nbsp;Job enlargement and job enrichment tactics have been exposed as cover for ""we're not hiring anyone else."" &nbsp;They no longer want to hear: ""Just hang on until the economy picks up"" or ""The recession is almost over, be patient."" &nbsp;The concept of waiting five years or more for something is not easy nor is it popular in the US (good or bad, it isn't).

 So what happens with these employees left to work for a manager? &nbsp;They function, but that's it. &nbsp;The spark is gone for two-thirds of them. &nbsp;Now, the manager, seeing what is before him/her, also begins to experience a waning. &nbsp;All of the enthusiasm he/she begins with is eaten up by merely keeping people moderately productive. &nbsp;Happiness is desired, but a chore to create. &nbsp;And engagement strategies are still on vision boards hanging in the manger's office.
</div> 
<div></div> 
<div>
 What my experience has shown me is that the simple task of asking works wonders. &nbsp;Managers, are you asking your employees how they are doing? &nbsp;I know that there may be complaints, but your head needs to come out of the sand. &nbsp;Ignoring the issues makes them fester and spread to others. &nbsp;Just because you know (or think you know) what your employees will say doesn't mean that they know you know. &nbsp;Ask them.
</div> 
<div></div> 
<div>
 And then ask them what ideas they have for improvement. &nbsp;Yes, ask them. &nbsp;Ask them how they would fix an issue, create better processes or enhance innovation strategies. &nbsp;Seek out their opinion, but be clear that all of the ideas may not be able to be implemented. &nbsp;Employees understand that there may be other issues at hand that they know little about or that the cost of some options may not be doable at the time. &nbsp;What's more important is that the employees know that they are being asked.
</div> 
<div></div> 
<div>
 But wait, there's more. &nbsp;What about the employees? &nbsp;Employees, are you asking your manager how you can be more involved? &nbsp;I know there may be frustration at all the employees have been doing to date, but perhaps the conversation can move towards skill improvements and new learning objectives. &nbsp;Your asking is not to be rude, insulting or full of attitude (you know what I mean by attitude. I have a teenager and a tween in my house...I know attitude). &nbsp;Ask for the sake of knowing and growing.
</div> 
<div></div> 
<div>
 What if you, as an employee, are not interested in your job? &nbsp;Well, that is a different conversation, but it's one that you must have. &nbsp;You want to be productive and useful. &nbsp;If you're part of the two-thirds, then only you can change that. &nbsp;Find your motivation. &nbsp;Recapture that joy for the company, if you can.
</div> 
<div></div> 
<div>
 Asking seems like such a simple strategy, but many times, the simplest is the most effective. &nbsp;Regardless of the side of the employment relationship you are on, you can ask for clarity, for involvement and for improvement. &nbsp;The better the company does, the more likely you'll have a job. &nbsp;It's to everyone's benefit to ask and to act.
</div> 
<div></div> 
<div>
 It's a new year. &nbsp;Make a decision to just ask.

<!--more--><p>At the workplace, many would just laugh at such a perspective. &nbsp;Why would I be excited to make another widget for someone to use doing something that I don't really care about? &nbsp;Engagement with the task at hand is not easy to maintain at a high level. &nbsp;There are days when it's just not exciting to represent a company in service or production. My question, though, is does it have to be?</p> 
<p>Self-fulfilling prophecies happen. &nbsp;If you tell yourself that you'll fail, you will. &nbsp;If you are sure that a certain person won't be attracted to you and therefore wouldn't say yes to a date, you're probably correct. &nbsp;We believe the imposed hype much more than we should. &nbsp;In physical exercise, this is referred to as unhealthy self-talk. &nbsp;The exercise isn't the issue; it's the negativity that runs through your head that's a problem. &nbsp;Isn't it possible that a reason you are not at the performance level you'd like to be or at the management level you'd like to be is because you don't really believe you can?</p> 
<p>When a decision is made to accept a job offer, it is not common for the new employee to walk in thinking, ""How can I do the least amount of work possible and still get paid?"" &nbsp;I'm not saying this never happens, but it is not the common approach. &nbsp;Most will want to do a great job by giving great effort. &nbsp;At what point did giving the best that you've got become passe?</p> 
<p>Listen, even though I may not know you, I know you. &nbsp;We all get hung up on lousy managers, lousy processes, lousy total rewards plans...I get it and I have belly-ached about those things, too. &nbsp;But one thing I am more sure of now then ever before is that I allowed those things to take away my power to be excellent in what I do. &nbsp;I settled for half-best rather than the best best I could offer. &nbsp;I downplayed my talents in order to make room for the complaining. &nbsp;I robbed myself of personal growth because I was frustrated, angry or fed up with the work I was doing or the company I was doing it for. &nbsp;No more.</p> 
<p>Let's walk into the new year convinced that we are awesome, convinced that we can be excellent at what we do. &nbsp;Let's stop playing those negative tapes and make the decision, despite all of the reasons to complain, to excel at our work. &nbsp;We spend so much time working, why not make it rich and valuable? &nbsp;Why not change our perspective so that we pursue excellence?</p> 
<p>I understand that some of you will read this and think I am being too sensitive or too Stuart Smalley-like. &nbsp;I would have to come back to you and say I am not. &nbsp;This isn't about feeling good, primarily, although that will be a by-product. &nbsp;I am coming at this a bit more strategically. &nbsp;According to the World Economic Forum, the United States has fallen to fifth in ranking; the US was last in first place in 2008. &nbsp;Each year since has seen another step down the world business/economic health rankings.</p> 
<p>The US worker is one of the best in the world, hands down. &nbsp;As such, we must reflect what we are. &nbsp;To compete in the global market, which we ALL do to some degree, we must function at a higher level of excellence than our competition. &nbsp;Giving the best that we've got is necessary more than ever; our country has to regain lost ground. &nbsp;Product development, technology and innovation, and improved processes are crucial; however, without excited and committed human capital, these initiatives will fall flat. &nbsp;We make the difference.</p> 
<p>The new year is right around the corner. &nbsp;Take some time to realign your enthusiasm and your commitment to the work you do. &nbsp;You are in the role you are in for a reason. &nbsp;Believe in what you know how to do. &nbsp;It matters to your co-workers, your management, your company and your country...it should matter to you.</p>","https://21594889.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21594889/Imported_Blog_Media/img_personal-excellence.jpg","","PUBLISHED","false"

 In my living room sits a piano that belonged to my wife's grandmother. &nbsp;It's an upright and it sounds beautiful. &nbsp;My wife dabbles on it from time to time. &nbsp;What I wished for was that at least one of my three children would want to play the piano. &nbsp;What I am currently dealing with are three children with little desire to do so and one bitter, Italian dad (can you guess which one I am?)
 <p></p> 
 <p>I had visions of being serenaded by my kids, you know, something similar to what the kids in The Sound of Music did. &nbsp;I mean, am I asking for too much?</p> 
 <p>Simply, yes. &nbsp;My vision for The New Partridge Family is not shared by the ""company"" I lead at home (please don't tell my wife I said I lead the company). &nbsp;Forcing my objectives onto the group will not yield the product I desire, and even if I demand that they comply, what kind of music will I hear? &nbsp;My expectation of soul-stirring singing with instruments in accompaniment will fall flat as the hearts of those performing will not be committed to the task at hand.</p> 
 <p>Often, in the organizations we serve, we are tasked with fitting ""square"" employees into ""round"" jobs. &nbsp;We have become accustomed to by-passing talent and ability in order to meet basic skills requirements. &nbsp;When I was working for the major distribution center for a national retailer, I could and did perform the tasks of sorting, re-packaging and tagging that took place. &nbsp;I met the basic skills requirements, but would that have been the best use of my talent or skill? &nbsp;Couldn't there be people in your organization that are misaligned? &nbsp;Are you listening to the music and reporting on what you hear? &nbsp;Who's out of tune?</p> 
 <p>I very much enjoy classical and operatic music. &nbsp;When I hear those instruments working together to tell a story through music, my mind is transported. &nbsp;I know I am hearing greatness, but not because the players are playing their instruments well. &nbsp;Rather, it's because the players&nbsp;<b>love</b>&nbsp;playing their instruments well; it's what they were made to do. &nbsp;Do we ever ask in a performance review - What do you think you were made to do? &nbsp;OK, un-cringe. &nbsp;It's not about religion or personal belief systems necessarily, but more about aligning talent to the best possible role. &nbsp;Isn't that a responsibility in HR?</p> 
 <p>Mentoring programs and coaching sessions are great; I do them, I know. &nbsp;However, those things will just be meetings if the other person involved does not see purpose and passion in what he/she is doing. &nbsp;My kids aren't playing the piano because it's not what they are passionate about. &nbsp;Baseball, soccer, dance, art...those things get my kids excited to perform and to do it well. &nbsp;What a miserable existence to force someone to do something they don't want to do. &nbsp;Why would it be any different for the employees at our companies?</p> 
 <p>Sometimes, the answer may be that an employee does not fit with the organization. &nbsp;It is okay to realize an employee is not performing to the level needed and with the passion required. &nbsp;Fit matters. &nbsp;Often, the employee is already aware so the conversation about fit should go smoother. &nbsp;The ability for our organizations to achieve greatness is, in part, a product of our strategic interface with all personnel and in understanding the KSA's involved.</p> 
 <p>Look for where the organization is out of tune and address it. &nbsp;Don't just grit your teeth at the awful sound and hope it passes soon. &nbsp;Be proactive. &nbsp;Our role in human resources allows for our expertise to shine in such a capacity as this.</p> 
 <p>By the way, you may have asked yourself whether I can play the piano. &nbsp;As long as playing the two keys needed for the&nbsp;<i>Theme from Jaws</i>&nbsp;counts, then yes, I play.</p>

<!--more--><p>How about this question: What is the business case for workplace flexibility? &nbsp;Too often the goal seems to be flexible people with flexible schedules working for flexible companies. &nbsp;What the heck does that even mean?! &nbsp;One thing I do know is that profitability is not supposed to be flexible. &nbsp;It's supposed to increase and move along a trajectory of growth. &nbsp;I don't want the success of a company to be measured in its constant ability to reinvent itself at the cost of its core product or service all in the name of flexibility. &nbsp;What if Apple decided that since being flexible is the latest rage, it would add a restaurant chain and a apron manufacturing subsidiary to its business? &nbsp;Silly and over-the-top, right? &nbsp;However, the point is that many of us in HR forget about what the company we work for is really about.</p> 
<p>The company is about making money. &nbsp;Every person working in the organization is in sales (just ask&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.toddcohen.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Todd Cohen</a>). &nbsp;What the company is selling is its product or service to the global market. &nbsp;We don't want to take our eyes off the ball for the sake of being flexible. &nbsp;What if it won't work to have flexible staffing for your organization? &nbsp;What if you really need people to work the manufacturing equipment from 9AM to 5PM? &nbsp;Those employees cannot telecommute. &nbsp;They might not be able to have ""fluid hours"" (a new phrase I've heard). &nbsp;Sometimes, the work has to be done in a certain time and in a certain way. &nbsp;So, I ask you, are we to say that company is not flexible?</p> 
<p>Sometimes being inflexible is just what's needed. &nbsp;Sticking to what you know the business is about ought to be protected by the C-Suite and HR. &nbsp;There is a vast difference between studying markets and preparing for changes in production, assembly and marketing compared to putting programs in place to make employees happy at the destruction of the work itself. &nbsp;Some of those companies have granted their employees the most flexible schedule imaginable...the companies closed their doors.</p> 
<p>Please hear me clearly, I am flexible. &nbsp;I am a pretzel. &nbsp;In HR, we have had to walk into each day ready to conquer whatever comes our way. &nbsp;However, that is to be done to protect the core steady belief in the mission and vision of the organization. &nbsp;We have to take hold of those non-negotiables and refuse to apologize. &nbsp;The company's success will depend on someone somewhere making a decision and sticking with it. &nbsp;We cannot be flexible about everything. &nbsp;You're not a bad HR person if you cannot be flexible all the time.</p> 
<p>Re-read those mission statements. &nbsp;They are matter-of-fact and unapologetic in what the goal of the company is. &nbsp;Inflexible? &nbsp;Nah, right on the money.</p>","","","PUBLISHED","false"

 One of the toughest things to do is to dismiss an employee. &nbsp;Even when the cause is based upon poor performance, attendance issues or insubordination, it can be a tough conversation. &nbsp;It's likely that the person being terminated has financial and/or familial obligations that will be affected by this dismissal. &nbsp;An HR professional and the manager involved often know about these obligations but must forge ahead with the right course of action.
 <p></p> 
 <p>What's even sadder is the sigh of relief that co-workers and management may make after this person's termination. &nbsp;You can almost hear William Wallace yell, ""Freedom"" to those in the surrounding cubicles. &nbsp;The frustration and annoyance that person brought will not be missed and the relief is palpable.</p> 
 <p>In an exit interview, I would love to share with the terminated individual the relief that this dismissal is bringing so many others. &nbsp;There will not have to be a team of people covering for you when you're not here. &nbsp;There won't be a need to do your work for you due to your lack of drive to perform well. &nbsp;No one will have to walk on egg shells because of your short temper and entitled attitude. &nbsp;Obviously, these would be extremely tough points to bring up, and the timing would be like pouring salt on a wound.</p> 
 <p>So, think proactively. &nbsp;Am I that person? &nbsp;Am I the person who, although still working, acts like the terminated person described here? &nbsp;Will anyone miss my contribution should I not be here any longer or are most counting the days until there's enough documentation to terminate me?</p> 
 <p>Sadly, the people who need to hear this message the most will read this blog and think of others for whom it applies. &nbsp;The reality is that every person in each organization has a role in the health of the fabric of the company. &nbsp;When there is a tear in that fabric, it does not affect just that area, but the entire piece. &nbsp;Once a tear begins, the entire fabric is weakened at that point and it's usage expectancy is short. &nbsp;Turnover is expensive and it's vital to address those areas of concern with those people who need help.</p> 
 <p>In the Fifth Dimension song ""One Less Bell to Answer,"" Marilyn McCoo (of course I know who it is without performing a search) sings about her love that is now gone and shares all the reasons why it's good he's gone. &nbsp;Yet, ultimately, she sings, ""I should be happy, but all I do is cry."" &nbsp;I liken it to an employment relationship. &nbsp;When someone is terminated, there are reasons to rejoice. &nbsp;The aggravation is gone, the forced micro-managing can stop, but the reasons to cry are just as many. &nbsp;The time wasted, the morale impacted, the money spent...all of this and more.</p> 
 <p>Companies need to address issues as a matter of constant performance review, not an annual report. &nbsp;Coaching is constant. &nbsp;Work the team daily. &nbsp;If someone is not a fit, you'll know much sooner than later and can make those cuts without much pain. &nbsp;Allowing a sore to fester is never the answer.</p> 
 <p>And if you're that employee who is the cause of grief and frustration, stop it. &nbsp;You know better and can make better choices. &nbsp;You're intelligent and capable; it's likely how you got the position in the first place. &nbsp;Today is the day to make the decision to work towards healthy interaction, participation and production. &nbsp;You can do this.</p> 
 <p>The company needs your involvement; it's why you were hired. &nbsp;Remember, people should want to answer the door when you ring, instead of being relieved when you leave the keys on the table on your way out.</p>

<!--more--><p>It may be difficult to feel grateful, honestly. &nbsp;You may barely have enough time to read this. &nbsp;You're doing three jobs under the umbrella of ""trying to do more with less."" &nbsp;You may look back over the last four or five years without a pay raise and wonder if it's all worth it. &nbsp;I mean, where are your flowers? &nbsp;Who's celebrating you?</p> 
<p>You've been told, ""You should be thankful that you even have a job!"" &nbsp;Unemployment is still incredibly high and it doesn't look to be getting any better any time soon. &nbsp;So, just shut your yap and do your job, right? &nbsp;Is that based on gratitude? &nbsp;Doesn't that sound a bit demoralizing?</p> 
<p>I think of my grandmother, who was a saint on earth, and her complete commitment to work. &nbsp;She would often say how fortunate she was to even have a job. &nbsp;She took a SEPTA bus (the public transportation system in Philadelphia) to work each day until she was 81 years old. &nbsp;When she said the words, ""I'm lucky to have a job,"" they weren't said because she drank the corporate Kool-Aid, but rather, the tone was convinced and soft. You heard her heart in the words.</p> 
<p>You see, my grandmother was a teenager during the depression. &nbsp;She began as a seamstress when she was a child and never stopped working. &nbsp;The environments and the work changed, but she didn't stop working. &nbsp;She had three children and went right back to work after delivery. &nbsp;She didn't have FMLA or a temporary disability...she had a family and she needed to make ends meet.</p> 
<p>I lived with my grandparents for seven years. &nbsp;When I would come home from work and begin whining about customers, bosses and co-workers, she would start singing ""You Don't Bring Me Flowers."" &nbsp;Now, she only knew the first line of the chorus (the same as the title), but she would make up the rest of the words. &nbsp;It was ridiculous. &nbsp;I tried to teach her the right words a hundred times. &nbsp;She didn't care. &nbsp;That wasn't the point.</p> 
<p>Gratitude is a decision. &nbsp;My grandmother was a waitress for the last forty plus years of her life. &nbsp;It was not glamorous. &nbsp;She did not make a fortune. &nbsp;She didn't make excuses, instead she made everyone who walked into the restaurant or cafeteria feel like he/she was the only customer in the place. &nbsp;She took pride in what she did, not because of the money or the status, but because she felt it was the right thing to do. &nbsp;And she was grateful for it.</p> 
<p>As I sit back and think about our current employment situation and the corporate cultures that have been allowed to fester, I am saddened by our state of gratitude. &nbsp;Whether we flip burgers or cook up mergers, we should be thankful for what we do. &nbsp;It's not because the work is to define us, but instead, we should be defining the work. &nbsp;My work should be an outlet for who I am. &nbsp;When I work, I am reflecting my unique ability to contribute and to help others succeed.</p> 
<p>With this attitude, I have stopped looking for work to ""bring me flowers."" &nbsp;Instead, I bring them to work. &nbsp;My gratitude should be palpable and infectious. &nbsp;I should be the catalyst for change. &nbsp;I don't want to sing the same old song with Neil and Barbra. &nbsp;It's time for a different melody.</p>","","","PUBLISHED","false"

<!--more--><p>What happened to that moment in time? &nbsp;Where is the enthusiasm? &nbsp;What happened to that eager conscientiousness? &nbsp;Has the company you work for sucked the life right out of you?</p> 
<p>I remember working in education years ago. &nbsp;I had great plans. &nbsp;I reopened the school library, established an after-school homework ""crew"" for those at-risk and increased scores for national testing. &nbsp;Unfortunately, the atmosphere I was in did not encourage its teachers. &nbsp;Many of those would cry or express outrage each morning. &nbsp;This is not the stuff of enthusiastic engagement.</p> 
<p>So why? &nbsp;Why does this happen in many companies? &nbsp;The answer lies in a few places. &nbsp;First, we have an unrealistic expectation of work. &nbsp;When work is the goal, it is a let-down. &nbsp;The work itself can garner some enthusiasm for a while, but it is temporal. &nbsp;The lasting elements are found in how that work contributes to the larger mission. &nbsp;When a company does a poor job in disseminating a consistent message of mission, it is quite easy for the work to seem unrelated. &nbsp;As this happens, disappointment, frustration and blame set in. &nbsp;Departments begin to look at other departments as the problem, as if it's because of ""them"" that your department isn't succeeding. &nbsp;Our workplaces are to be filled with people who fulfill a vital part of the workflow process rather than the norm of workplaces filled with work done by workers.</p> 
<p>Secondly, we forget to be leaders instead of followers. &nbsp;In every department or cubicle, you are a leader. &nbsp;You may not have a team reporting to you, but you at least have yourself to lead. &nbsp;Often, we are too easily influenced by negativity at work. &nbsp;Listen, I am a fan of ""The Office."" &nbsp;Michael Scott is one of the best characters created on network television. &nbsp;But think about actually working at Dunder-Mifflin. &nbsp;Wouldn't you just hate it? &nbsp;Wouldn't you just become another participant with Oscar, Dwight and Angela in commiserating about how awful it is to work there? &nbsp;There are people reading this right now who live in that environment and have fallen into the bad habit of participating in negativity. &nbsp;Be a leader in your conversations, in your self-discipline and in your career (rather than your job).</p> 
<p>Thirdly, we hate those new people with all their enthusiastic rah-rah. &nbsp;Many of us have worked in places where the establishment is so embittered that when new recruits arrive, the long-timers look them over like ""lifers"" in a prison movie. &nbsp;The look is about how can I break you down? &nbsp;How can I wipe that smile off your face? &nbsp;This place stinks so don't think you'll be happy; be ready to be miserable like the rest of us. &nbsp;Many have trained themselves to hate what they once had - excitement, pride in the work, passion to succeed for the sake of the company. &nbsp;We've got to re-train ourselves and get back to what we know is right!</p> 
<p>Make a choice today to be different. &nbsp;This isn't about self-help; it's about corporate health. &nbsp;Wouldn't you rather be motivated to get to work each day? &nbsp;Wouldn't you want to enjoy your time at work? &nbsp;Think about how many hours you spend at work. &nbsp;Why not make it great? &nbsp;And think about what the entire company will be like under such an influence.</p> 
<p>Choose a moment in time today to reclaim what you once were. &nbsp;Don't allow anyone to decide for you how you should think about work. &nbsp;If many are negative, then they've made that choice. &nbsp;You don't have to.</p> 
<p>I love working with recent college graduates. &nbsp;Their energy and desire to learn is palpable. &nbsp;It energizes me and causes me to remember, with fondness, how much I wanted to tackle the world with my great ideas and enthusiasm. &nbsp;You know what? &nbsp;I can still tackle the world. &nbsp;I might need some Advil, but I can still do it.</p>","","","PUBLISHED","false"

<p>Becoming the expert in your responsibilities is your job. &nbsp;You've got to take a view of your position that it is yours. &nbsp;The onus is on you. &nbsp;Take that job and make it yours through your diligent effort to know all that you need to and how to implement it effectively. &nbsp;You should be performing at the highest level.</p> 
<p>And what you should also consider is equipping others to be ready to do the same. &nbsp;Teach those under you to make confident decisions and to be ready with the knowledge needed for success. &nbsp;Create an atmosphere of excellence. &nbsp;The perspective is not do this so that you will be seen as the office suck-up; move beyond the politics and status quo of your organization. &nbsp;Understand that you've been hired to bring this kind of excellence. &nbsp;Just because there may be some who do not subscribe to this point of view, do not allow that to thwart your power and drive.</p> 
<p>By allowing your department to function at a higher level of achievement, you will be seen not as the only point of information, but as a leader of information. &nbsp;Those in your department will share the burden of being excellent, which is much easier to handle with many hands!</p> 
<p>And for those of you who really are standing with one foot out the door, perhaps approaching your work this way will change your disposition. &nbsp;That doesn't mean that you won't move on to another opportunity, but rather, that you will approach it as someone with a strong work ethic and high desire for excellence. &nbsp;Wouldn't it be fantastic if your current employer could recommend you to another role because of the leader you are? &nbsp;What if the recommendation from your superior read like this: ""You're my sun, my moon, my guiding star, my kind of wonderful, that's what you are."" &nbsp;Um, well, maybe not quite like this, but you get the idea.</p>

<!--more--><p>Morale in the workplace is so tenuous. &nbsp;It's a fragile figurine from Tennessee Williams' ""The Glass Menagerie."" &nbsp;Walking into situations like the one described above takes thoughtfulness to respond. &nbsp;Think about how you've reacted in the past. &nbsp;Do you participate in the conversation? &nbsp;Typically, this is the easiest reaction. &nbsp;I mean, who wants to be the party-killer? &nbsp;The problem with this reaction is two-fold. &nbsp;One, you can't seriously think that this same group of people won't kill your reputation the minute there's reason to do it, do you? &nbsp;When blood is in the water, the sharks look for it all over the place. &nbsp;What might be said about some other employee today could be easily replaced by what would be said about you tomorrow. &nbsp;And secondly, it contributes to mediocrity in the workplace. &nbsp;Why push yourself to be the best if you just open yourself up to criticism? &nbsp;Who wants to be the subject of a group of employees' rumor-fest? The ""did you hear's?"" will occur if someone performs well or is recognized for being special in some way.</p> 
<p>I don't want to be completely negative. &nbsp;I am sure there are some workplaces where the gossip and rumor-mill does not exist. &nbsp;I am sure that some companies have total engagement of employees who are on-task the entire time while at work. &nbsp;However, the amount of companies that fall into this category would be the same if I were to count the number of men and women in the current music industry who can actually sing...it's a small number.</p> 
<p>Stop participating. &nbsp;You have to work in this environment. &nbsp;Why would you stand for the stress of keeping up appearances? &nbsp;Is this high school? &nbsp;Aren't we done with those days? &nbsp;I mean, I still love my Swatch watches (and I still have both of them), but I don't engage with others as I did then. &nbsp;I don't want to watch my back or to be worried that excellence is something to be mocked.</p> 
<p>Be excellent! &nbsp;Be loyal to the workplace and to your co-workers! &nbsp;If the disease of rumor and gossip is present, address it. &nbsp;Don't let it slide. &nbsp;Remind those involved that it's just as easy for any employee, including them, to be the topic tomorrow. &nbsp;You're there to be productive, not destructive. &nbsp;Take a stand!</p>","","","PUBLISHED","false"

<!--more--><div></div> 
<div>
 Adding positions within a company may be a part of the growth strategy. &nbsp;Sourcing and recruiting for these candidates should be more than just posting an ad online and hoping for a great candidate. &nbsp;The amount of resumes in response can be overwhelming, and what occurs more and more is a weak resume review.
</div> 
<div></div> 
<div>
 So, what can you do? &nbsp;How can you do more to stand out? &nbsp;How can you be prepared to be what a company wants?
</div> 
<div></div> 
<div>
 Well, I wouldn't recommend sending a singing telegram or having your mom call on your behalf. &nbsp;I would have your knowledge and skills ready. &nbsp;Start with these:
</div> 
<div></div> 
<div> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Adaptability: Are you flexible? &nbsp;Can you multi-task?</li> 
  <li>Problem-Solving: How do you handle problems? &nbsp;What reasoning skills do you use?</li> 
  <li>Leadership: Who has followed you (what type)? &nbsp;What style do you use?</li> 
  <li>Work Ethic: How have you demonstrated that you are self-motivated?</li> 
  <li>Passion: Do you have the ability to generate enthusiasm around you?</li> 
  <li>Willingness to Learn: Do you handle change well?</li> 
 </ul> 
</div> 
<div></div> 
<div>
 These are only a handful of skills to review in creating a resume and in preparation for an interview. &nbsp;There are many more skills that should come up, but for all of them, be ready with examples to back up what you affirm. &nbsp;An employer wants to understand who you are and how you will benefit the company.
</div> 
<div></div> 
<div>
 So, it really could be you that an employer is looking for. &nbsp;Get motivated to put that best foot forward. &nbsp;If it means playing Lionel Richie to motivate you, then do it...just be sure your windows and blinds are closed.

<!--more--><p>Usually, there are external factors that distract us from the work at hand. &nbsp;Annoying managers, complaining customers, broken processes or sub-par technology vie for first place as to why we can't get our jobs done or at least done smoothly. &nbsp;We tend to work thoroughly with a desire to succeed (statistics back up that fact), but we do usually fall apart in one area. &nbsp;Power.</p> 
<p>We give power to so much outside of us. &nbsp;Those factors that I mentioned above may not ever change. &nbsp;Those managers will always be annoying (to a degree), customers will complain, processes will be a work in progress and technology is ever-changing. &nbsp;Those things, however, do not represent you or what you do. &nbsp;Too often we settle for those reasons and excuses. &nbsp;For example, why does technology deserve power in your work process? &nbsp;If it's not working, then figure out another way to be exceptional for a client.</p> 
<p>When I got my first job, I was thrilled. &nbsp;I was a dishwasher at Friendly's Restaurants. &nbsp;It's funny because I loathe emptying the dishwasher at home...I wonder if it's connected. &nbsp;Anyway, I remember my boss often telling me, ""Make it work,"" whenever there was an issue with the Hobart machine or the rude servers who tossed (literally) dishes at me. &nbsp;While his lack of compassion is not recommended, I do appreciate his message.</p> 
<p>We have to make it work more than we do. &nbsp;Innovation is born out of problem solving. &nbsp;Be a problem solver and improve processes. &nbsp;Figure out how to reduce customer complaints. &nbsp;What would need to be improved upon? &nbsp;What experience is the customer having and how could it be better? &nbsp;If the technology is not working, then grab a pen. &nbsp;Think about the goals of your position and of the company.</p> 
<p>Shake off your old way of thinking and embrace a new mode. &nbsp;Change the record that's been playing and get into the groove of engagement and enthusiasm.</p>","https://21594889.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21594889/Imported_Blog_Media/power_cylinder1.jpg","","PUBLISHED","false"

<!--more--><p>So, it's early morning. &nbsp;You are groggy from working late the night before. &nbsp;As you make your way from the bedroom to the bathroom, you stub your toe. &nbsp;After you share your thoughts aloud on that incident, you stumble to the shower. &nbsp;The water is cold and it is staying that way. &nbsp;Great, the pilot light went out on the water heater. &nbsp;So, you text your boss to say you'll be a few minutes late. &nbsp;Just after the send button is hit, you bobble the phone and into the toilet it goes. &nbsp;Um, okay. &nbsp;This day has to get better, right?</p> 
<p>I feel like screaming even just reading back what I just wrote. &nbsp;What a frustrating start to the day! &nbsp;Unfortunately, while the circumstances may be different (I hope!) each day, many experience that desperate frustration, but not at home. &nbsp;It's usually the place of employment that causes angst for us. &nbsp;As you walk in the door, those ""oh no"" issues hit you like Chase Utley up to bat. &nbsp;Haven't you had those days where after 20 minutes of being at work, you reach for your keys and debate making a break for it?</p> 
<p>If you find that you are not alone in your workplace in having this perspective more often than should be, then there is a problem. &nbsp;So, what do you do? &nbsp;Simple, take action.</p> 
<p>Seek out your manager and ask him/her to lunch. &nbsp;Let's face it, if you want a willing ear, a meal is a great way to do it. &nbsp;If your manager is the problem, then ask for the superior above that person to grab coffee with you. &nbsp;Try to do it outside of the office. &nbsp;Find neutral territory.</p> 
<p>Make a decision not to complain but to be constructive. &nbsp;The fact that you want to make work better shows that you care. &nbsp;Embrace that perspective, but choose your words carefully. &nbsp;Share your heart with your supervisor, which means both negative and positive. &nbsp;You are addressing with your boss how you are feeling; this is different than saying, ""everyone feels that work stinks."" &nbsp;Don't raise barriers but work to build a bridge.</p> 
<p>These words are not meant to be trite. &nbsp;There is a great benefit to being humble in presentation. &nbsp;You want things to be different. &nbsp;Processes and procedures need help, so share what you see. &nbsp;You are doing it to make things better; don't just wait for change to happen somehow.</p> 
<p>A miracle doesn't happen everyday. &nbsp;Haven't you closed your eyes after another issue passes your desk in the hopes that when you re-open them, there would be a difference in what you see? &nbsp;Man, that disappointment is real, isn't it? &nbsp;So, you be the miracle. &nbsp;Make a difference in the growth of your company today.</p>","https://21594889.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21594889/Imported_Blog_Media/utley1_576.jpg","","PUBLISHED","false"

<!--more--><p>With smart phones being the most popularly used cell phone type today, it's important for companies to make a plan to utilize the apps that these devices have. &nbsp;For example, the new millennial generation thrives on technology. &nbsp;Many of those folks use their smart phones and even tablets to apply for jobs. &nbsp;When companies don't have mobile-ready sites or applications, direct recruiting will be hindered. &nbsp;CareerBuilder and Monster have those apps in place already, but that may not help an organization with its recruitment strategy if those partners aren't included.</p> 
<p>There is no denying the daily reliance on cell phones today. &nbsp;Grabbing your keys and wallet/purse before you head out the door now means grabbing your phone, too. &nbsp;My parents and in-laws, who are in their 60's, are texting and updating their status on Facebook using their smart phone app (I mean, it's important to know that Bingo is happening in 10 minutes). &nbsp;If that generation is attacking the technology this way, imagine what it's like for the up and coming generation. &nbsp;There is no room for companies to ignore the interfacing that has to be done and done well with the tablet and smart phone app users.</p>

<p>Companies struggle with knowing HOW to find those employees who are excited to enter into a great time of learning. &nbsp;Sourcing, selection and recruitment are skills developed. &nbsp;It is not automatic that every manager or director will be competent in finding great talent. &nbsp;Who is teaching that management level to interview well? &nbsp;I walk into many companies that do not offer any type of training or coaching in the recruitment process to their management. &nbsp;How would we expect success? &nbsp;What about the liability of EEOC violations in interviewing? &nbsp;A shot in the dark cannot be the way.</p> 
<p>Yes, this season is about getting back to life, but it's time to, also, get back to reality. &nbsp;A realistic approach to finding qualified, compatible candidates has to be defined. &nbsp;When were the last job analyses done? &nbsp;When has the desire to be diligent about understanding the knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary for a particular job be encouraged? &nbsp;Do you understand the long-term benefits of such a commitment?</p> 
<p>Maybe by the time the leaves begin to fall, some of those great new hires will be sitting right next to you because of the changes your company has made to the hiring process. &nbsp;A new classmate at the office. &nbsp;You could trade that bologna sandwich...it's been in your desk for two weeks.</p>","","","PUBLISHED","false"

<p>Is the goal of the American company to cruise? &nbsp;T. Harv Ecker is quoted as saying, “If you’re not growing, you’re dying.”&nbsp; Perhaps this is familiar to you, but is there motivating power behind it?&nbsp; The words might ring true, but the goal of the saying is not to merely recognize a truth; rather, it is meant to inspire growth and to turn away from the apathy or stagnation in which you might find yourself or your company.</p>
<p>I have found it interesting to watch companies miss strategic growth initiatives because of being comfortable and thinking that’s good enough.&nbsp; Ask Kodak or Blockbuster about missing business development opportunities.&nbsp; Where would those companies be if they had paid attention to the markets and to technology more intently?&nbsp; What if they had led the charge rather than being punished for missing the charge altogether?</p>
<p>Strategic business growth takes a bit of pain and discomfort.&nbsp; There will be trials and errors, but that will help to establish a culture of innovation and of growth.&nbsp; The healthiest plant is pruned so that it will flourish more and produce fruit.&nbsp; Why would that concept not apply to an organization?&nbsp; Sustainable corporate growth comes out of a strategic, thoughtful plan with the goal of capitalizing in a particular market or markets.&nbsp; Companies are desperate to find a way to do this.</p>
<p>While this may not happen in companies today because they are comfortable, it is certainly not the only reason.&nbsp; Companies may not have the resources, know-how or time to develop and drive a plan.&nbsp; I have not found the company that says it does not want to grow and become more successful (I’m sure they are out there), but good intentions will not change the direction a company needs to go.&nbsp; A plan is needed.</p>
<p>Humareso is here to make that plan happen.</p>

<!--more--><p>The dictionary defines the adjective “amazing” as causing great surprise or sudden wonder (<a href=""http://www.dictionary.com/"">www.dictionary.com</a>).&nbsp; When the word is used today, does that ring true to the noun it is describing?&nbsp; I have had an amazing vacation and my children are amazing, but does the meaning in those contexts lose its force when I have also said that my shoes are amazing or that the chocolate water ice I just ate was amazing?</p> 
<p>If everything is amazing, then nothing really is.</p> 
<p>So, when it comes to businesses, does the word amazing enter your mind?&nbsp; Do you only have pictures of Google and Apple when you think of the word connected to companies?&nbsp; Is the reason those companies are amazing due to their technology, their dress code or their in-house dry cleaning service (ok, I really do like the last one).&nbsp; In a world where many things are amazing, why is it a rarity to hear it used of a company?</p> 
<p>In the US today, there is a lack of “amazingness” due in large part to the overall health of the companies we work for and own.&nbsp; A natural pulse of the organization is missing, mostly due to the desperate view of production.&nbsp; Those quotas are often the primary “what I care about” for management and shareholders.&nbsp; While I would never say that those numbers don’t matter, what I would say is that those numbers may be a percentage of what they could be if there was a commitment to organizational health and true organizational development.</p> 
<p>This is a worthy concept and one that needs much more unpacking.&nbsp; For now, ask yourself a few questions:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What do I think of my organization?&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it amazing?</li> 
 <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What do I understand of the stated values of the company versus the real values of the company?&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there a difference?</li> 
 <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Is the health of my organization something I have even considered?&nbsp;&nbsp;If so, in what context?</li> 
</ul> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It is quite possible that you are a key person in the health check of your company.&nbsp; Take some time to consider.&nbsp; And have an&nbsp;<strong>AMAZING&nbsp;</strong>day!</p>","","","PUBLISHED","false"
